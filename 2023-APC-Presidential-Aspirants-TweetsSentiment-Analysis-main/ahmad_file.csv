0,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-27 20:42:36+00:00,I want to thank the traditional rulers and the entire Igbere community for the honour done to me. I also want to thank Senator Orji Uzor Kalu whose late father we have gone to remember today.
1,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-27 20:42:36+00:00,"In the spirit of that common purpose, I can say today that I am a son of Igbere and with my cap signifying the title conferred on me, I can stand anywhere, in any part of Nigeria proudly and say I am from Igbere community."
2,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-27 20:42:35+00:00,"Nigeria is designed by the Grace of God to be a nation of many people of different orientation, different sentiments but we must be a people with common purpose and common destiny and this is what we are trying to achieve."
3,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-27 20:42:35+00:00,"Today and indeed even tomorrow and for ever, we can achieve better. We can achieve more when we are united."
4,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-27 20:42:34+00:00,Nigeria needs all of us to be united. Nigeria needs all hands to be on deck. Nigeria needs the effort of each and every part to make it work and we can make it work.
5,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-27 20:42:34+00:00,It doesn't matter where you come from. It doesn't matter what you believe in. What matters is that you are a Nigerian and the other person next to you is a Nigerian too.
6,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-27 20:42:34+00:00,The conferment of this title is an attestation to the fact that national unity is something we all must embrace because the Nigeria needs all parts of the country to make things work.
7,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-27 20:42:33+00:00,"The honour was done to me during my visit to Abia State to attend the 10th year memorial anniversary of the father of the Senate Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu which held at Igbere in Abia state."
8,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-27 20:42:33+00:00,"Earlier today, the Igbere Clan Council of Ndi Eze in Abia State honoured me with the High Chief title of Nwannedinamba 1 (our number one Brother in Diaspora) and as a member of Ezumezu Circle of Igbere Ebiri in the state. https://t.co/YSZ47obP2W"
9,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-25 06:18:56+00:00,I celebrate with you and enjoin all of us to remember the essence of the august occasion.
10,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-25 06:18:56+00:00,"Given the fact of the second wave of the Coronavirus pandemic, we should keep our guard up and comply fully with the non-pharmaceutical guidelines that have been put in place by the authorities."
11,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-25 06:18:55+00:00,"In the true spirit of the season, let's show love to our neighbours, kindness to the less-privileged and vulnerable, and tolerance to one another across the lines of faith, politics and ethnicity; in the spirit of the unique sacrifice and teachings of Jesus Christ."
12,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-25 06:18:55+00:00,"With the prayers of the faithful and our continued support for the Government, I am confident that Nigeria will surmount its challenges, attain its manifest destiny of greatness and become the pride of its citizens and the entire Black World."
13,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-25 06:18:54+00:00,"As we celebrate, however, people of faith should remember our country in their prayers, especially for divine guidance for the government in its efforts to improve national security and strengthen the economy."
14,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-25 06:18:54+00:00,... but also ensure that their strains do not stop a merry and responsible celebration of Christmas in the country.
15,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-25 06:18:53+00:00,"Aside from the global health emergency of COVID-19, Nigeria also faces security and economic challenges.

I am however confident that the resilience and positive attitudes of Nigerians would not only help our country to prevail against the challenges..."
16,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-25 06:18:53+00:00,"This year's celebration comes at a time the world is combatting the resurgence of the Coronavirus pandemic, which has forced many countries to ramp up health safety protocols at a time people traditionally gather to share love in celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ."
17,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-25 06:18:52+00:00,I felicitate with the Christian faithful and Nigerians generally as they join the rest of the world in celebrating Christmas.
18,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-21 18:57:48+00:00,"Having passed the budget, our charge to the Committee on Niger Delta is to ensure the proper utilization of funds by the Commission through strict oversight. The Committee should sit-up and ensure that these funds are properly utilized."
19,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-21 18:57:48+00:00,"Now that the IMC have gone and a new management in place, we gave our Committee on NDDC the go ahead to work on the budget and the Committee presented their report which we adopted and passed today."
20,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-21 18:57:47+00:00,Recall that the Senate had suspended consideration on the Budget 2020 for NDDC because of our believe that the IMC was indicted by the Senate and therefore we could not interact with the Committee that had been indicted on the Appropriation of the commission.
21,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-21 18:57:47+00:00,"Similar to the 2021 Appropriation Bill, the Senate also approved the 2020 budget estimate of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)."
22,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-21 18:57:47+00:00,"I must warn however that the National Assembly will not accede to another request from the Executive to extend the capital implementation of the 2020 budget. Therefore, Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government must fully utilize this extension."
23,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-21 18:57:46+00:00,We have granted the request for this extension to ensure that the funds that are available for 2020 are not lost. This will guarantee sufficient injection of funds into Nigeria’s economy. That is absolute fight against the recession that we currently in.
24,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-21 18:57:46+00:00,"With the Senate’s earlier approval for the extension of capital implementation of the 2020 budget, there will be two budgets running simultaneously; one from 1st January, 2021, up to 31st March, 2021; and then the implementation of the 2021 budget itself to start from January."
25,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-21 18:57:45+00:00,"This budget that was passed by the National Assembly today, is to ensure that the economy is supported fully through public expenditure, because Nigeria's economy depends largely on public expenditure."
26,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-21 18:57:45+00:00,"With the passage today, we have recorded another milestone like we did in 2019 by passing the budget before the end of the year, thus reaffirming our commitment to ensure that we run our budget cycle from January to December."
27,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-21 18:57:43+00:00,"Today, the Nigerian Senate, after a rigorous and painstaking exercise passed the 2021 Appropriation Bill, which is now ready for transmission to the President for his assent. https://t.co/z591kf2ZLT"
28,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-18 08:26:02+00:00,I also commend the security forces and the intelligence community for their coordinated efforts that brought this saga to early closure just as I urge them to continue in the same spirit and with the same approach in addressing other security issues across Nigeria.
29,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-18 08:26:02+00:00,"I commend the prompt intervention and productive engagement of President Muhammadu Buhari, Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina state and others which resulted in the release of the children."
30,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-18 08:26:01+00:00,"This sad recurrence is, therefore, enough warning to us as a nation to deploy all the resources required for the security of our educational institutions, and indeed of everywhere else where our children gather, to protect them against cowardly attacks by primitive terrorists."
31,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-18 08:26:00+00:00,The blemish of those earlier incidents is still on us as a country and we had hoped that the outrage that they sparked would mean such never happened again in Nigeria.
32,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-18 08:26:00+00:00,The nightmare sadly reminds us of our country's continued vulnerability to heartless crimes such as the kidnap of hundreds of schoolgirls in Chibok in 2014 and the Dapchi incident of 2018.
33,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-18 08:25:59+00:00,"I particularly rejoice with the parents who had been under tremendous emotional stress as they prayed for the safe return of their children. The past few days have been harrowing for them, their teachers and all of us as a nation."
34,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-18 08:25:59+00:00,The news that all the kidnapped boys regained their freedom unharmed would delight their parents and all people of goodwill in Nigeria and across the world who have been horrified by the ordeal of the innocent children.
35,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-18 08:25:58+00:00,"I am relieved at the news of the release of the hundreds of schoolboys kidnapped last week Friday at the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara in Katsina State."
36,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-17 08:52:17+00:00,"On this august occasion of your birthday, Mr President, I pray that God would continue to imbue you with wisdom, courage and good health to continue to safely pilot the ship of the nation towards the dream of its people.

Happy Birthday, Mr President!"
37,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-17 08:52:16+00:00,"On our part, the ninth National Assembly will continue to work harmoniously with the President for the peace and development of Nigeria and the well-being of our people."
38,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-17 08:52:16+00:00,"As a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), I am also delighted with President Buhari over the process he has set in motion for reforming and rebuilding our great party for fulfilling its historic mission of leading Nigeria into political stability and economic prosperity"
39,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-17 08:52:15+00:00,"President Buhari is leveraging on his integrity and good standing with the masses to courageously guide Nigeria through a difficult phase into future prosperity

I urge every citizen to look at the big picture and continue to stand with the President in this patriotic mission."
40,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-17 08:52:15+00:00,"From the ongoing massive infrastructure projects across the country, series of programmes targeted at lifting the most vulnerable, like the social investment scheme, to the numerous bold initiatives of his government aimed at diversifying the economy...,"
41,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-17 08:52:15+00:00,"Mr President, in all the years of his leadership of our country has shown undeniable commitment to the unity, peace and even development of Nigeria."
42,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-17 08:52:14+00:00,"I heartily felicitate with His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, as he marks his 78th birthday on Thursday.

I join family members, friends, officials and associates of the President in rejoicing with him for marking the occasion in good health and good spirit. https://t.co/cdFufDElxZ"
43,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-12 08:56:33+00:00,I pray for the sweet repose of his soul and for comfort for his loved ones in this period of their grief and after.
44,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-12 08:56:32+00:00,His contributions as a public opinion  shaper and principled politician are profound and have put his imprints on the Nigerian history despite his early home call.
45,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-12 08:56:31+00:00,Sam Nda-Isaiah fervently believed in the Nigerian project and this is reflected in his writings and the editorial focus and tone of his Leadership Newspaper.
46,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-12 08:56:30+00:00,"The death of Sam Nda -Isaiah, a pharmacist-turned newspaper columnist, publisher and politician at the young age of 58 years is shocking to say the least."
47,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-12 08:56:29+00:00,"I commiserate with the Newspaper Proprietors' Association of Nigeria, and the Government and people of Niger State over the sad loss."
48,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-12 08:56:28+00:00,"It is with a heavy heart that I condole with the family, friends and the Nigerian newspaper industry over the death of the Publisher of Leadership Newspaper, Sam Nda-Isaiah. https://t.co/EFzqyS6UlY"
49,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-09 18:14:43+00:00,"Just as I said about two weeks ago, I want to reiterate that the National Assembly would work hard to ensure that the Electoral Reforms Bill is passed by the first quarter of 2021."
50,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-09 18:14:41+00:00,We have consistently remained focused on the Electoral Act amendment and Constitutional amendment that may also refine the Electoral Act and the political environment generally in Nigeria.
51,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-09 18:14:41+00:00,"People may chose to accuse us for any other thing but not what we do here. Without anybody holding us responsible, we have achieved most of those things that we have set as targets and Electoral Act amendment is one of those targets."
52,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-09 18:14:40+00:00,"This step today further demonstrates that we remain committed to all the issues in our Legislative Agenda, one of which is the Electoral Reform Bill being given the priority it deserves."
53,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-09 18:14:39+00:00,"Today, I declared open a One Day Public Hearing on a Bill for an Act to Repeal the Electoral Act No. 6  2010 (as amended) and enact the Independent National Electoral Commission Act 2020, jointly organised by the Senate and House Committees on INEC and Electoral Matters. https://t.co/ydLmjuD83K"
54,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-08 18:58:03+00:00,"The award will spur me to continue to champion the cause of women, more so in the passage of laws to promote their interests and repeal of discriminatory laws that hinder the realization of gender equality and women advancement."
55,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-08 18:58:01+00:00,"My sincere appreciation to the Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen for honoring me today with the HeForShe Award, which is a global initiative and a solidarity movement for gender equality between men and women, in recognition of my support to the women issues. https://t.co/xeY26PaLOB"
56,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-07 12:34:54+00:00,"On behalf of my Distinguished colleagues, I once again assure the nation that we will continue to put in our best in the onerous task of nation building."
57,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-07 12:34:54+00:00,"I consider the award as a further call to duty, not just from a personal point of view but on behalf of the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the National Assembly in general."
58,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-07 12:34:53+00:00,"I am proud to be joining past recipients of the award among them notable names like President Jerry Rawlings (1995), President Julius Nyerere (1997), Dr Nelson Mandela (2000), President Yonweri Muzeveni (2003), President John Kuffor (2008), President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (2011)."

Aji, is in recognition of my ""long-standing dynamic service to the Nigerian state"" and ""undying commitment to the entrenchment of democratic ideals in the Nigerian polity."""
60,DrAhmadLawan,2020-12-07 12:34:52+00:00,"Last night, the Public Policy Research and Analysis Centre (PPRAC) honored me with the 2019 Zik Prize in Political Leadership at an impressive ceremony that took place in Lagos, the commercial nerve Centre of Nigeria. https://t.co/nyw0KrxVQP"
61,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-20 19:33:15+00:00,We believe that we should pass our ammendments within 2021. Similarly the ammendment to the Electoral Act is going to be within that year 2021 to ensure that we don't encounter unnecessary distractions.
62,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-20 19:33:15+00:00,"The constitutional amendment at the moment, is not very warm because of the activities on the 2021 budget but the two committees in the Senate and the House are already working behind the scene to ensure that as soon as we pass the budget, the activities will start in earnest."
63,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-20 19:33:14+00:00,"Regarding the Electoral Act (Amendment Bill) and the constitutional amendment, it is my assurance that the National Assembly would have been done with the current process by 2021."
64,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-20 19:33:13+00:00,"Oil is like water now. Almost every country now has oil. So if you don't provide a competitive environment in Nigeria, oil companies will have no difficulty relocating to other countries. So we will ensure that we have a competitive environment for business and for investment."
65,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-20 19:33:13+00:00,"What we are going to come out with will of course also support our business people, the oil companies that are investing and infact retain and encourage new ones to come to Nigeria to invest."
66,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-20 19:33:12+00:00,We are taking our time to do a thorough job because it is a very delicate and sensitive piece of legislation. We will take our time to ensure that what comes out is a product of legislation that will ensure that Nigeria earns it's revenues from this industry as it should.
67,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-20 19:33:11+00:00,"The PIB on the other hand is one of the most essential legislations that we have to have in this country, and we have already commenced work on it. What we want to ensure is that the bill is passed before the end of the second quarter of next year."
68,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-20 19:33:11+00:00,"So far, we achieved that in the 2020 budget. We believe we did the right thing. We promised Nigerians that we will do that and it is going to be part of our legacy in the Ninth National Assembly."
69,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-20 19:33:10+00:00,"On the 2021 Appropriation Bill, I want to assure Nigerians that the National Assembly is working hard to see to its passage by the second week of December, 2020, by the Grace of God."
70,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-20 19:33:09+00:00,"Today, I had the cause to speak yet again on the expectation of Nigerians regarding the passage of some critical bills - The Amendment to the 1999 constitution, the Petroleum Industry Bill, the Electoral Bill and even the 2021 Appropriation Bill all before the National Assembly. https://t.co/GKZsO8f5xi"
71,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-15 13:50:22+00:00,This gesture was meant to be just support and my personal Intervention to complement what the state government had done for them.
72,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-15 13:50:22+00:00,"Those other victims whose farmlands were affected shared among themselves food items including Rice, Maize and Millet. Provisions were made for a total of 650 bags of each of the food items."
73,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-15 13:50:21+00:00,"To those communities whose Houses were affected by the flood, 4000 bags of cement, 480 bundles of Zinc, 1150 logs of timber and 160 bags of nails were distributed to them."
74,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-15 13:50:21+00:00,I also used the opportunity to give out some relief materials to victims of the recent flood that occurred in parts of my Constituency in Bade and Jakusko Local Government Areas.
75,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-15 13:50:20+00:00,"During the course of performing this exercise when I visited the people of my constituency, I seized the opportunity to also flag off the construction of some township roads both in Gashua and Nguru."
76,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-15 13:50:20+00:00,"I think we are doing the right thing and I believe that next year, by the Grace of God, we will do more if we see more people who need our Intervention."
77,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-15 13:50:19+00:00,"And since I could afford it, I thought it was my duty to provide means of some Intervention. So we initiated this programme in 2018."
78,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-15 13:50:19+00:00,We started this because we noticed that people had those challenges at that time and yet majority of them didn't have the means to receive any medical attention.
79,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-15 13:50:18+00:00,This medical outreach is in keeping with what we believe is important and necessary Intervention for our people who need either the surgeries or the general treatment to recover their sight or improve their sight.
80,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-15 13:50:17+00:00,"This year alone, more than 5000 patients with eye-related cases are expected to receive treatment and also more than 6000 patients with hypertension, diabetes and the likes will benefit from the gesture."
81,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-15 13:50:17+00:00,"The free medical services which includes eye treatment and surgery, gynecological check up and surgeries for hernia, hydrocele, fibroid and others was started in 2018 with main focus on eye related medical conditions but has now been expanded in scope and number of beneficiaries."
82,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-15 13:50:16+00:00,"Yesterday at the General Hospital, Gashua and Federal Medical Centre, Nguru all in Yobe State, I flagged off an expanded medical outreach programme for my constituents in Yobe North Senatorial District. https://t.co/N4jFgiNLyE"
83,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-11 15:58:19+00:00,I pray that Almighty Allah grant him Aljannatu Firdausi and the family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.
84,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-11 15:58:19+00:00,"His life personified the struggle for the underdogs, adding that his legacy is indelible and will always be cherished."
85,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-11 15:58:18+00:00,Alhaji Balarabe Musa was a principled political leader who throughout his life consistently championed the cause of the masses. He shunned material benefits and remained constant on the path of his convictions all through his long and illustrious political career.
86,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-11 15:58:18+00:00,I condole with his family over his death and commiserate with the government and people of the state over the incident.
87,DrAhmadLawan,2020-11-11 15:58:17+00:00,"It is with deep sense of loss but total submission to the will of the Almighty Allah that I received the sad news of the death of foremost politician and former Kaduna State Governor, Alh. Balarabe Musa. https://t.co/dUhbFrzAjR"
88,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:35+00:00,I thank you all for your wise counsel to the protesting youths to embrace peace and for Government to be open and sincere in addressing the issues that the youths have raised so clearly.
89,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:34+00:00,"In particular, I thank all Nigerians for their patience and understanding in this trying moment in our dear country."
90,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:34+00:00,I thank all Nigerian leaders and other well-meaning Nigerians for their interventions towards restoring peace and order after the unfortunate degeneration of the protest into chaos and brigandage in many parts of the country.
91,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:34+00:00,"While still grappling with the havoc of COVID-19, the country can ill afford yet another epidemic that has now appeared in the form of the lawlessness that is going on."
92,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:33+00:00,"However, as regards those criminal elements unleashing terror on our cities under the guise of the protest, I urge the security agencies to forthwith but with utmost restraint, restore law and order across the country and bring the criminals to justice."
93,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:33+00:00,I call on our patriotic youths to leave the streets as Government has heard their voices and is addressing their grievances. This is also necessary to avoid unwittingly continuing to provide covers for the criminals and fifth columnists in our midst.
94,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:32+00:00,"Now that the mindless carnage has distorted the purpose of the protests, I urge the youths to join hands with the authorities in bringing an urgent cessation to the violence."
95,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:32+00:00,I also call for a thorough investigation of every criminal act that we have witnessed in the past few weeks with a view to bringing to justice all those elements who have so callously destroyed public and private property.
96,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:31+00:00,I send my condolences to the families of our security and law enforcement agents who have made the Supreme sacrifices in the course of their service to their fatherland.
97,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:31+00:00,"As we seek a path out of this regrettable crisis, my heart goes out to the victims of the reprehensible violence and criminality witnessed in the last few days in many parts of the country."
98,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:30+00:00,The National Assembly is fully committed to putting the necessary legislation in place for comprehensive reform of the Police to enhance their institutional integrity and efficiency.
99,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:30+00:00,... we will ensure that government fulfills the commitment it has made to the well-meaning agitators for police reform and good governance.
100,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:29+00:00,"In spite of the unfortunate hijack of the protests against police brutality by hoodlums to unleash horrifying violence, arson, looting and wanton destruction of public and private property on the country..."
101,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:29+00:00,We will also work with the Executive to ensure that the five-point demands of the #EndSARS protesters which the government has committed itself to are fully implemented.
102,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:28+00:00,"In the same vein, to discourage impunity, we will insist that the perpetrators of the alleged abuses be prosecuted and sanctioned as appropriate."
103,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-26 07:47:28+00:00,I want to seize this opportunity to re-assure our youths that the National Assembly will collaborate with the Executive to ensure justice for victims of misconduct and rights abuses by personnel of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigeria Police.
104,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:19+00:00,...but we must never allow ourselves to be taken in the wrong direction of violent protest like we have witnessed in some parts of the country.
105,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:18+00:00,This is a country that we have to ensure that it works for all of us. People have the right to say this is not the way they want to go once it is a legitimate way to express themselves through peaceful protest...
106,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:18+00:00,"I will take this opportunity to urge all well meaning Nigerians that this is our country, that everyone must show interest in its survival and in its peace."
107,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:17+00:00,"Those that are going about protesting have shown clearly that they have no affiliation, no relationship whatsoever with the original #EndSARS protest."
108,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:17+00:00,...because the protests are now taking a different dimension from the originally conceived protest by those who meant well by asking for SARS to be disbanded.
109,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:16+00:00,"All leaders, regardless of their political affiliations, regardless of our religious passuasion, regardless of our geo-political locations, must stand up and ensure that these protests come to an end..."
110,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:15+00:00,I want to thank all Nigerians for the prayers and I want to urge opinion leaders and political leaders across the spectrum that this is of utmost concern to all of us.
111,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:15+00:00,"However, the time has come for the protests to stop and I want to appeal to all Nigerian political and religious leaders to stand up with a view to prevailing on the protesters to allow peace a chance."
112,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:14+00:00,"Subsequently, five demands of the protesters were accepted by the government generally because we believe that those demands are legitimate and we will continue to insist that the Federal Government must implement those demands it accepted from the protesters."
113,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:13+00:00,We are however not in support of any violent protest by anyone. We believe that the #EndSARS protest started very genuinely and those who started it are Patriots who wanted to see change and change was initiated immediately with the dissolution of SARS.
114,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:13+00:00,"The Senate has so far taken two motions with respect to #EndSARS, one of which is a declaration of support to legitimate and peaceful protest to #EndSARS and the second one with about five other far reaching resolutions."
115,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:12+00:00,"We have been talking, discussing, consulting with our colleagues in the Senate, in the National Assembly generally and people on the Executive side of government and outside of government on how best we can approach this issue, so that we are able to bring it to an end."
116,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:12+00:00,"We invited the IGP and the DSS DG for the briefing to enable the leadership of the Senate to be properly informed of the situation. But before then, we have been reading in the media, both Electronics and Print what has been going on."
117,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-21 19:51:11+00:00,"Earlier today, I led other principal officers of the Senate to receive security briefings from the Inspector-General of Police, Adamu Mohammed and the Director General of the Department of State Services, Yusuf Bichi on the protests being staged in some parts of the country. https://t.co/dipeaNcFKT"
118,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-16 10:05:57+00:00,The National Assembly will perform its constitutional function of working on the budget proposal in the best interest of our people.
119,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-16 10:05:57+00:00,"If any Ministry is not able to defend its budget by the first week of November, then that Ministry should forget about coming to the National Assembly for budget defense."
120,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-16 10:05:56+00:00,"This will be the only window, and nobody should assume that after this period, a Minister or any Head of Agency will come to the National Assembly to defend any budget."
121,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-16 10:05:56+00:00,"So, we are waiting for them from next week. Unlike last year, we would have a Programme which will take the remaining part of October and the first week of November."
122,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-16 10:05:55+00:00,"I’m sure that directive has remained in the clouds, in fact, the President even repeated a more serious one in his address to us at the retreat; that all Ministers and Heads of Agencies of government must come to defend the budget in person."
123,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-16 10:05:55+00:00,"Last year, President Muhammadu Buhari, gave specific orders that no Minister or Chief Executive should travel out of the country or anywhere else, without defending the budget of his or her Ministry or Agency."
124,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-16 10:05:54+00:00,"The Senate’s deadline for budget Defence would not exceed the first week of November. Therefore,  all Ministers and Heads of Agencies should avail themselves of the window provided for their respective budget defence, particularly in line with President Buhari’s directive."
125,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-16 10:05:54+00:00,"Before the suspension of plenary however, we’ll give consideration to the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) to enable it pass second reading and be referred to the relevant committees for legislative work, just the way we have done to the budget today."
126,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-16 10:05:54+00:00,"The Senate will from Tuesday next week commence defence of the 2021 budget estimates by Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government and therefore will be suspending plenary for two weeks."
127,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-14 09:05:04+00:00,Something has to give by virtue of horse trading and accommodation; some kind of understanding has to be reached so that ASUU goes back to work and our universities reopened.
128,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-14 09:05:03+00:00,"Just as I told them yesterday, ASUU cannot get just what they are asking for because it is simply unrealistic, and government cannot hold back and not do anything."
129,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-14 09:05:03+00:00,"I want to emphasized again that the Strike by ASUU is an ill-wind that does no one any good. Our children are home, whereas they should be in school. The continued closure of Universities on the flip-side poses security threat which on the long run would affect Nigeria adversely."
130,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-14 09:05:03+00:00,"I want to say that progress is being made as a result of the joint meeting and we are hopeful that in no distant time, both parties will reach a middle ground and bring our universities back to life again."
131,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-14 09:05:02+00:00,"Yesterday, we continued with our attempt to broker an understanding between the two parties by first meeting with the Ministers directly involved in the negotiation with ASUU, and then a joint meeting that included the ministers and the leaders of ASUU."
132,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-14 09:05:01+00:00,"On Monday, I led the leadership of the Senate to a meeting with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), over the continuous closure of our universities as a result of the unresolved agreement between the union and the government. https://t.co/FHvHYgyRUG"
133,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-13 17:12:08+00:00,Let’s give the government the chance to implement those reforms as quickly as possible while ensuring that those culprits who were involved in the killing and maiming of Nigerians are brought to book.
134,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-13 17:12:08+00:00,"I think the protest has yielded the desired result so far, and there may not be need to continue to have protests again when SARS has be disbanded."
135,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-13 17:12:07+00:00,"I however want to plead with Nigerians to suspend the #EndSARS protest, particularly in view of the recent disbandment of the police unit by the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu and several other commitments and steps that have been made to ensure that #SARSMustEnd"
136,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-13 17:12:07+00:00,I am delighted that President Muhammadu Buhari has promised to bring to justice all those involved in perpetrating various atrocities against Nigerians and I want to assure that we’ll join hands in ensuring that those found culpable will be made to face the weight of the law.
137,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-13 17:12:06+00:00,"SARS was funded by public funds and the entire essence of having the Nigeria Police Force is to ensure that there is law and order, and that there is security for our people. When SARS turned against the people, it was right for the people to protest peacefully."
138,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-13 17:12:06+00:00,"On the floor of the Senate today, I reiterated the fact that Nigerians acted within their rights to protest the killings of, and brutality meted against citizens by men of the now dissolved Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) across the country. https://t.co/c7io0gu8AT"
139,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-12 17:34:34+00:00,ASUU has shared with me the product of their invention which they prefer as an alternative to IPPIS. We will ensure that we immediately find a middle ground so that our schools can reopen.
140,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-12 17:34:33+00:00,This is to say that we have to accommodate each other. The country must ensure that Universities remain open and functioning because it doesn't serve anybody any good when the Universities are shut.
141,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-12 17:34:33+00:00,"Our situation today is something that everyone knows what it is. It's a very stressful economic situation and I believe that government is supposed to even, within this kind of situation, play its own part. It's obligations must be redeemed within the confine of what we can do."
142,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-12 17:34:33+00:00,Government cannot expect to have it all it's way and I believe that ASUU shouldn't expect it to be that everything it asked for must be given.
143,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-12 17:34:32+00:00,"Therefore, the government and ASUU ought to find a common ground for our institutions, particularly our Universities to open and of course, offer the kind of services that are expected of our Universities."
144,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-12 17:34:32+00:00,We really don't need this kind of situation where our Universities are shut. Our children are the victims of this.
145,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-12 17:34:31+00:00,The meeting was to explore further how the Senate and indeed the National Assembly could intervene to resolve the issues that were yet outstanding so that universities which has been under lock and key as a result of the strike action by the union can be called off.
146,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-12 17:34:31+00:00,"Earlier today, I waded into the disputes between the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and the Federal Government over the enrollment on the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS) and other outstanding issues. https://t.co/ZEqwHUrn5N"
147,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-08 18:52:08+00:00,Our Joint Committee must do everything possible for us to have a document or report that we would work with in the Senate and something that Nigerians and investors will be happy with.
148,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-08 18:52:07+00:00,"If we are able to take the debate, pass the PIB for second reading and refer the document to our Joint Committees on Petroleum (Upstream and Downstream); and Gas, the committee can keep work on the PIB warm, while we are working on the budget."
149,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-08 18:52:06+00:00,"It is obvious that everybody is waiting for the PIB to be attended to, but while we are going to do our best to deliver on this expectation, we will take sufficient time to work on it because it is a very sensitive document."
150,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-08 18:52:05+00:00,"We want to get the document to our Joint Committee before we suspend plenary, otherwise, the document will remain unattended to throughout the time that we would be handling the budget; and that means we can only come back to it around November or December, and that would be late"
151,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-08 18:52:05+00:00,"The critical piece of legislation, after the debate on the floor by lawmakers, would then pass for second reading and be referred to the Joint Committees on Petroleum; and Gas for further legislative work."
152,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-08 18:52:04+00:00,"Accordingly, I informed my colleagues to prepare for this task so as to avert any delay in consideration, resulting from our decision to suspend plenary for one month to enable Ministries, Departments and Agencies of Government defend their respective budgets for the year 2021."
153,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-08 18:52:03+00:00,"In line with our resolve to break the jinx on the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), forwarded by President Muhammadu Buhari to the National Assembly last week, we have fixed Tuesday, October 20, 2020, as the date for the commencement of debate on the Bill. https://t.co/T4IehvFT5k"
154,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 18:27:04+00:00,"We need to really work closely with the Executive arm of Government. I know it is going to be a tough call, because it will be said this is not a time for people to lose their job, but somehow we need to find a way out of this as the cost of governance is high."
155,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 18:27:03+00:00,"There is need for us to muster the political will, because we know what to do, but when it comes to doing the right thing, we find it difficult to do it."
156,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 18:27:02+00:00,We must also look at reducing the cost of governance especially with the merger of agencies as the recurrent expenditure profile of government is too high.
157,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 18:27:01+00:00,"But where we must borrow as this is inevitable, especially as we did not apply what we had during the good years to prepare us for the rainy days, such borrowing needs to be carefully applied."
158,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 18:27:00+00:00,"There are lot of businesses that have interest in the development of our infrastructures, so we should explore the other means in order to ensure that we don’t accumulate so much deficit and end up spending so much of our revenue servicing debts."
159,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 18:26:59+00:00,I think we should explore on those so that we minimize borrowing.
160,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 18:26:58+00:00,"There are projects that I feel we should ensure we don’t borrow to fund. We should explore other opportunities in sourcing funds such as the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT), Public Private Partnerships and so many other options."
161,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 18:26:56+00:00,"While we put in all necessary measures to enhance government revenue, the Federal Government would need to reduce its borrowing by seeking alternative ways of implementing infrastructural projects not funded through local and foreign loans."
162,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 18:26:55+00:00,"... just as the Federal Government need to streamline stamp duty collection by Ministries, Departments and Agencies."
163,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 18:26:54+00:00,"As a result, we will be looking at amending Sections 21(1) and 21(2) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act as well as other laws guiding the operation of all revenue generating agencies with a view to plugging wastages,..."
164,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 18:26:53+00:00,"In the passage of the MTEF, improving the revenue generating and remittance capacity of Agencies of Government was central to our decision as this is key to the early and successful implementation of the budget."
165,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 18:26:53+00:00,"Today, the Senate passed the 2021-2023 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper ahead of the presentation of the 2021 Appropriation Bill to the National Assembly by President Muhammadu Buhari tomorrow. https://t.co/mTbMFbqW0W"
166,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 16:36:19+00:00,"There are good elements in SARS, and they have been doing a wonderful job. If you scrap it, you lose the chance of getting those that are doing well to continue to do so. Anybody in SARS or any security agency that commits excesses should be prosecuted."
167,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 16:36:18+00:00,"I would not agree with the suggestions to scrap SARS because srapping of agencies might not be the right thing to do. Rule of law should be the guiding principle. If anyone does the wrong thing, they must be prepared to face the consequences."
168,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 16:36:18+00:00,"If someone who is supposed to protect Nigerians kills a Nigerian unduly, without any due course of process, he probably loses his life too. And that is what we expect to see happen."
169,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 16:36:17+00:00,"The recent incidents should not be swept under the carpet. Those involved in the incidents should be arrested and prosecuted. It is not enough to dismiss them from service, what does the law say if he kills someone? What happens to those that have killed innocent Nigerians?"
170,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 16:36:17+00:00,It cannot be overemphasized that this arbitrariness and brutality must be put to a stop and one of the ways of doing this is to ensure that any security personnel involved in the killing of innocent Nigerians must be made to face the full weight of the law.
171,DrAhmadLawan,2020-10-07 16:36:16+00:00,"The need to check the culture of arbitrariness and brutality of Security Operatives to Nigerians, particularly by operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), whose activities has been in the media landscape for a while now was today discussed on the floor of the Senate. https://t.co/EcVNnBu37s"
172,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:20+00:00,"Let us abide by the public health safety protocols to avert a second wave of the pandemic.

I wish you all Happy Celebrations!"
173,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:19+00:00,"The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and our health workers at the frontline are working very hard to flatten the curve of the spread of the disease, so we as members of the public must not drop the ball by letting down our guards."
174,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:18+00:00,"Finally, as we celebrate our Independence Anniversary, permit me to remind us of the need for us all to continue to  be conscious that the Coronavirus pandemic is still very much with us."
175,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:18+00:00,Such understanding between the government and the people is always required to move the nation forward.
176,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:17+00:00,Organised labour in particular deserves special commendation for the patriotism they exhibited in the management of the recent disagreement over certain policy decisions arising from the reform programme of the government.
177,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:17+00:00,I wish to salute the resilience of the Nigerian workers in the face of the challenges we face as a nation.
178,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:16+00:00,"The overall objective of the periodic ammendment of our laws is to make them keep pace with the changes that each epoch requires, strengthen the bond that keeps us together and to cement peace and progress in our beloved country."
179,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:16+00:00,Fellow Nigerians should take advantage of this opportunity by taking active part in the constitutional review process.
180,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:15+00:00,"In this regard, the ninth National Assembly is committed to having another look at our constitution, the grundnorm for our co-existence as a nation, with a view to making it a document of the Nigerian people."
181,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:14+00:00,"On our part as the Legislature, we will continue to provide true representation to the Nigerian people and to strive to make their government work for them."
182,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:14+00:00,Our democracy is a vehicle for the pursuit of our individual and collective aspirations. We all have roles to play to keep the vehicle roadworthy and fit for purpose.
183,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:13+00:00,"We value our democracy and the rights it confers on us as citizens of a democratic nation. However, the expression of these rights need not be a clog in the wheel of our national unity, peace and development."
184,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:13+00:00,"As has been said, democracy is a journey rather than a destination. National development too is always a work in progress that requires the patient and unconditional commitment of all patriots."
185,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:12+00:00,We should not allow unnecessary magnification of our teething problems by some people to shake our faith in the great destiny of our country.
186,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:12+00:00,This cause must remain a proud heritage for the current generation of Nigerians and a baton to pass to future generations.
187,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:11+00:00,This cause fired the zeal of our founding fathers and inspired them to make the great sacrifices  that they made to bequeath to us our independence.
188,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:10+00:00,Our commitment to the cause of building a nation in which none is oppressed and of which all is proud must therefore remain unshakable.
189,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:10+00:00,Some of us may not see the wood for the trees due to some unmet expectations. But a broad perspective of issues will strengthen rather than weaken our aspiration of building a great Nigeria.
190,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:09+00:00,"... but if we look at  great nations throughout history, we would realise that all such experiences are common features of nation-building."
191,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:09+00:00,"Our national journey may have been tortuous, our progress slow and unsteady, and primordial fears and sentiments may occasionally cast dark clouds over our unity and threaten our resolve to stick together...,"
192,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:08+00:00,"Indeed, patriotic Nigerians have ample reasons to celebrate the fact that in spite of the clear challenges that the differences in our tongues, modes of worship  and other elements of our diversity pose to nationhood, we have remained Together."
193,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:08+00:00,"It is in this sense that I consider the theme for the 60th Independence anniversary, ""Together"", as apt."
194,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:07+00:00,"While we celebrate the Diamond Jubilee Anniversary of our country as a sovereign nation, the occasion is also auspicious for a sober reflection on the progress that we have made, the challenges that we face and the future that we desire as a nation."
195,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-30 18:44:06+00:00,"My Independence Anniversary message to Nigerians

I heartily felicitate with fellow Nigerians on the occasion of our 60th Independence Anniversary. https://t.co/oMAxkiVQ6f"

https://t.co/N8iMjAKpFt https://t.co/09EnUIbwT5"
197,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-28 20:18:42+00:00,"We are glad that the bill is now in the National Assembly even though not before the National Assembly. I imagine that by tomorrow when the communication to the House and the Senate will be read, then it will be before the two chambers of the National Assembly."
198,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-28 20:18:41+00:00,"The Ninth Assembly wants to work with every stakeholder, have a clear understanding of every provision so that, at the end of the day, we will break that jinx together and provide the oil industry a legislation that will make it more effective and efficient at the end of the day."
199,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-28 20:18:40+00:00,"We want to see an oil industry in Nigeria that is properly regulated, an oil industry that not only sustains the investment that we have but attract even more investment, an oil industry that is very competitive."
200,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-28 20:18:40+00:00,"This time around, the bill has come as an executive bill to the National Assembly and the two chambers of the National Assembly promise that we will break that jinx and see to the passage of the bill."
201,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-28 20:18:39+00:00,"The PIB is said to be jinxed probably from 2007 to 2019. It's either the bill were sponsored by the Executive and not passed as was the case in the 6th and 7th Assembly or as sponsored by the legislature in the 8th Assembly, broken into three bills, passed but not assent."
202,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-28 20:18:38+00:00,The meeting was essentially for these officials to brief the National Assembly leaders on the focus of the Petroleum Industry Bill which has been sent to us by President Muhammadu Buhari and would be read anytime as we resume plenary sessions tomorrow.
203,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-28 20:18:36+00:00,"A while ago, the leadership of the National Assembly concluded a meeting with the Minister of State for Petroleum, Timbre Silva, Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari and some other top officials in the Petroleum sector. https://t.co/D7XqP5se9T"

205,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-24 13:02:36+00:00,Significantly improving road safety in Nigeria is an urgent challenge for the relevant authorities and other stakeholders in our transport sector. We have to bring an end to the rampant carnage on our roads.
206,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-24 13:02:35+00:00,"While we mourn those who have so unfortunately lost their lives and pray for the speedy recovery of the injured, the incident underscores the need for constant review of our road safety strategy and mechanism with a view to making them more effective in preventing road carnages."
207,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-24 13:02:35+00:00,It is sad and totally unacceptable that such tragedy keeps recurring on our roads despite ample road safety regulations and enforcement personnel.

215,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-23 07:59:20+00:00,"The African Continental Free Trade Agreement is therefore a step in the right direction for the growth of African economies, through limited restrictions, leading to the stimulation of trade, commerce, and industry."
216,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-23 07:59:20+00:00,"Aside facing the challenges of unemployment, and underemployment, which have been a trigger for both regular and irregular migration, the economies of African countries have been characterized by low productivity, reduced efficiency, and the problem of limited resources."

241,DrAhmadLawan,2020-09-10 16:18:18+00:00,It is the reason why we will strive to surmount the challenges of limited resources to fend for this population group. This also requires creativity on how to engage them.

313,DrAhmadLawan,2020-07-08 17:54:19+00:00,"For proper and effective oversight, someone with his background will definitely bring value to the activities of the committee. So, in addition to being the Chairman of the Committee on Industries, he was also Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Marine Transport."
314,DrAhmadLawan,2020-07-08 17:54:19+00:00,"When we are to appoint the leadership of Committees, because of what I came to know about his background, I thought he was going to be an asset to the Senate Committee on Marine."

Something that we can go back to in three months, in six months and say where we are exactly."
320,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-30 19:45:02+00:00,"At the meeting, I charged the Inspector-General of Police to provide timelines for the implementation of the Community Policing in the country, because we believe in the National Assembly that the security situation in the country requires that we make it number one priority."

327,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-29 20:52:28+00:00,"The government has been doing a lot as part of its obligations to provide some form of Intervention. I'm quite aware that for this year, probably starting from last year, over N600 billion was earmarked for this sector to improve."
328,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-29 20:52:27+00:00,"So between now and the first quarter of next year, our task will be to work together with the Discos to ensure that we put those blocks in place to support the eventual increase in tariffs."

330,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-29 20:52:26+00:00,The agreement is that there is not going to be any increase in the tariffs on July 1st. While we are in agreement here that there is no question on the justification of the increase but the time is simply not right and appropriate measures need to be put in place.
331,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-29 20:52:25+00:00,We were emphatic at the meeting that the timing of the planned hike was wrong even though we had not much issue with the need to introduce a cost reflective tariffs for the power sector to attract the much needed investment.
332,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-29 20:52:25+00:00,"The planned increase in electricity tariff which was earlier billed to take off from July 1st, 2020 has now been deferred to the first quarter of 2021 as a result of the intervention of the National Assembly leadership, while we meet with President Muhammadu Buhari on the issue."
333,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-29 20:52:24+00:00,"Earlier today, I led the leadership of the National Assembly to a meeting with the Chief Executive of government electricity regulatory body and electricity Distribution Companies across the country, the outcome of which is the halt in the planned increase in electricity tariffs. https://t.co/klbI8s5svP"

340,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-24 23:04:06+00:00,Mr Speaker and I have a common vision of the role of the National Assembly in nation-building and national development and he has been consistent in the dogged pursuit of all that  he considers to be in the best interest of our country.

345,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-22 07:49:57+00:00,"Those who are heading these security agencies especially the service chiefs, must sit up, in fact we must have milestones and timelines on how we are going to deal with this and if they can’t, they should be shown the way out."
346,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-22 07:49:57+00:00,"And If after we provide some support and someone is found short of expectations, he should be shown the way out if he refuses to go. Because the lives of Nigerians are so precious and therefore must be more important than any other considerations or sentiments."
347,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-22 07:49:56+00:00,"The senate and indeed the National Assembly is positively disposed to receiving even supplementary budget purposely to address the needs of the security agencies so that we are able to empower them to fight Boko Haram, banditry and other security challenges across the country."
348,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-22 07:49:56+00:00,Part of the discussion I had with President Muhammadu Buhari during my visit to him yesterday were issues bothering on the security challenges in the country. I conveyed to him the position of the Senate: That we should do whatever it takes to improve the situation in the country https://t.co/zFH9d7tl0r
349,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-21 19:32:25+00:00,"I believe that we must go into the constitution of our party and see how we are to address the issues, but while we do this, we must not allow the situation to continue as it is today."

As representatives of the people, in the Senate, we believe that we need to up our game to ensure that this sector, very vital and important sector, receives the kind of attention it should given"
353,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-15 21:08:20+00:00,"We expect that by now, our level of generation, transmission and distribution would have been far better. That is what the country needs, but where we have given out N1.8 trillion that you hardly understand why it is given, then we need to ask questions."
354,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-15 21:08:20+00:00,We are taking a look at what has happened with the Share Purchase Agreement signed when these Gencos and Discos were given out. What are the responsibilities and the obligations of the Federal government and the successful investors and within which time were they expected.
355,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-15 21:08:19+00:00,"So for these reasons, we are taking a look at the power sector recovery plan because for us in the National Assembly, we want to see a sector that provides steady and regular supply of power."
356,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-15 21:08:18+00:00,"Just last year, we signed the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement, but how can Nigeria take advantage of that agreement when we don’t have power to produce anything in a competitive environment . We’ll just remain a dumping ground."
357,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-15 21:08:18+00:00,Jobs which ordinarily should be for Nigerians will have to be exported out. Little wonder some authourities say we lose about 29 billion dollars every year because of lack of sufficient and stable power. That is equivalent to what our people are supposed to earn.
358,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-15 21:08:14+00:00,"Nigeria has remained underveloped especially when we are talking about manufacturing, and even up to the level of empowering small businesses like artisans, the vulcanisers, the barbers."
359,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-15 21:08:11+00:00,"When the Gencos and Discos were privatized, the overall expectation of the Nigerian government and the citizens was that the power sector, after privatisation, would be far better, but what we have seen today is a far cry from what was expected."

Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu (Imo North), Senator Ignatius Datong Longjan (Plateau South) and Senator Rose Okoji Oko (Cross River North)."
367,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-11 20:27:50+00:00,"Today, before the Senate wound up the first year of its inauguration, we passed the revised 2020 budget which was necessitated by the adverse impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the country's revenue."
368,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-11 20:27:50+00:00,"These legislative interventions have direct positive impacts on the economy of our country. As more revenues are earned by government, the capacity and ability of government to address the infrastructural deficits are enhanced."
369,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-11 20:27:49+00:00,"Of particular mention among these successes is the passage of the 2020 budget before the end of December, as well as other legislative interventions we have been able to achieve under the year in review."
370,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-11 20:27:48+00:00,"Over the last one year, we worked extra hours and days to ensure that we take decisions and actions that are beneficial to Nigerians. We introduced over 450 bills, many of which has been passed and signed into law, while others are at different stages of legislative processing."
371,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-11 20:27:48+00:00,"There is no doubt that this has proven to be beneficial to the people we represent and for this, I commend the executive arm of government for the valuable partnership that has so far yielded improved service delivery to our citizens."

Today, there is a very good relationship, based on mutual respect, consultation, cooperation, collaboration and partnership."
373,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-11 20:27:46+00:00,"The Senate, working with the House of Representatives has created a productive and proficient National Assembly. As a bicameral legislature, we’ll continue to do this to engender stability and productivity."
374,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-11 20:27:45+00:00,"Our goals and targets were crystal clear, and we have remained resolute to achieve them. Our decisions have been collective, purposeful and patriotic. We have also committed ourselves into working in a bipartisan manner."
375,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-11 20:27:45+00:00,"Although, we have been slightly slowed down by the global pandemic of Covid19, today, we can say that we have remained on track to delivering on our promises to the Nigerian people."

402,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-02 20:35:37+00:00,@UuNdanusa @nassnigeria We’ll do our best Ndanusa. Our very best.
403,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-02 20:18:25+00:00,"I want to congratulate and commend them all for their sacrifices, just as I assure Nigerians that the Senate and indeed the National Assembly under my leadership as President of the Senate and Chairman respectively will continue to do our best for the good of the country."
404,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-02 20:18:24+00:00,"In just one week, the three committees have done very well, sacrificing nights and days to ensure that the reports are ready for consideration. They have done this despite the little time allocated to them to carry out the assignment."
405,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-02 20:18:23+00:00,"The report of the third committee, which is the Committee on Appropriation would also have been presented and considered on the floor today, but since the report on the MTEF &amp; FSP needed to be approved prior to that, action on it was stood down for another legislative day."
406,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-02 20:18:23+00:00,"Today, which makes it exactly one week after the committees were given that assignment, the report of two of them being the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Local and Foreign Debts were presented and considered on the floor of the senate."
407,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-02 20:18:22+00:00,"The requests - the revised 2020-2022 Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) &amp; Fiscal Strategy Paper (FSP), the revised 2020 Appropriation Bill, and the External Borrowing Plan were promptly referred to the relevant committees of the senate."
408,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-02 20:18:21+00:00,"Last week, His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari, in line with the global realities of the Covid19 pandemic submitted three requests for the consideration and approval of the Senate. https://t.co/G0Wxk5mZGf"
409,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-02 16:24:47+00:00,"We stand together shoulder to shoulder on this. We have to save our future, and these girls and women are the future of this nation"
410,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-02 16:24:46+00:00,"With the rising cases of rape across the country, what we need to do is to put in place stiffer penalties in Nigeria’s criminal and penal code that will serve as deterrent to perpetrators involved in the act."
411,DrAhmadLawan,2020-06-02 16:24:46+00:00,"Today, the Senate took a look at the brutality and rape of the girl child in Nigeria with particular reference to the cases of Miss Tina Ezekwe in Lagos, Miss Uwa Omozuwa at the University of Benin and the 12 year old girl in Jigawa state."
412,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-27 12:55:59+00:00,"On the part of the parents, I urge them to dutifully play their own role in providing the immediate needs for their children, for the future peace of the children, parents and the country."
413,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-27 12:55:59+00:00,"I also call on the authorities at the sub-national level who have not done so, to domesticate the Child Rights Act for the sake of the future of our children."
414,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-27 12:55:58+00:00,I urge for collaboration between the Federal and state governments in comprehensively addressing issues relating to the plight of Nigerian children.
415,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-27 12:55:58+00:00,"Although, Nigeria is still heavily burdened with a high number of out-of-school children, I want to assure our children that the National Assembly is fully aware of the challenges they face and will continue to work to guarantee them and our country a better future."
416,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-27 12:55:57+00:00,"The surest route to a happy and fulfilling future for our children is to provide them quality education and healthcare, and to protect them against all forms of abuse."
417,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-27 12:55:57+00:00,"I heartily felicitate with Nigerian children on the occasion of the 2020 Children's Day, a day set aside to highlight the realities of children in the society with a view to promoting their well-being and happiness now and for the future. https://t.co/NRwFMPkO15"
418,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-26 20:39:16+00:00,"I extend my condolences to the family of Mr Bakare and to members of the journalism profession in general over the untimely death of their colleagues.

May Almighty Allah grant the departed soul eternal bliss and comfort his loved ones and colleagues."

420,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-23 15:24:50+00:00,"As we celebrate with restraint as enjoined by our spiritual leaders and relevant authorities, I wish you all Eid Mubarak."
421,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-23 15:24:49+00:00,I wish to specially commend all our healthcare and other essential services providers who are at the front line of the fight against COVID-19 and assure them of full support of their lawmakers and representatives for victory against the vicious enemy.
422,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-23 15:24:49+00:00,I assure you on behalf of my colleagues that the National Assembly will continue to provide the initiatives and responses expected of a responsible Legislature in a vibrant democracy and as an arm of a caring government.
423,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-23 15:24:48+00:00,"We should also continue to pray for Nigeria, our dear country, for God's intervention against all the challenges that confront our nation and our world."
424,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-23 15:24:48+00:00,"Even as the holy month has ended, I enjoin us to continue to observe the health precautions  and sustain the acts of purity, charity, perseverance and tolerance in our daily lives and general conduct."
425,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-23 15:24:47+00:00,I congratulate the Muslim faithful on the successful completion of the fasting period despite the formidable challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic which stood between us and total observance of key rituals of the period.
426,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-23 15:24:46+00:00,"My Eid-el-Fitr message to Nigerians

I felicitate with all Nigerians and in particular the Muslim Ummah on the occasion of this year's Eid-el-Fitr which marks the breaking of fast and the end of the Holy month of Ramadan. https://t.co/Ye3EaHj9mE"
427,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-19 19:23:05+00:00,"We hope that they will be effective, but in the event that this thing is not addressed properly, there will be need for Govt to look into this privatization that has taken place, because probably the wrong investors took over or maybe government is not fulfilling its own promise."
428,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-19 19:23:04+00:00,"So, it is good our committee is investigating even the previous billions, in fact over a trillion. I mean that’s a lot of money and there must be justification for this."
429,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-19 19:23:03+00:00,"And for the next ten years, if there is nothing fundamental and drastic in this sector, nothing like power will be stable in Nigeria, and that will be unfortunate."
430,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-19 19:23:03+00:00,"If there are areas that we must intervene as a government, then it must be seriously justified, but the way it is, I think there is need to review this privatization and see what has really happened, because something is certainly not right."
431,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-19 19:23:02+00:00,"The Gencos have challenges too, and I think it is not a good commentary that we should continue to give them money after we sold them. These are businesses now, they are private businesses."
432,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-19 19:23:02+00:00,"We expected efficiency and effectiveness in power supply, but I think on both sides, the shared purchase agreements were maybe not adhered to. But definitely what is obvious is that the Discos have no capacity at the moment to give us power."
433,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-19 19:23:01+00:00,"I think the time has come for a review, because if we stay as it is today, for the next ten years there will be no power in Nigeria, as the situation is. So we need to be decisive about the power sector."
434,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-19 19:23:01+00:00,Generation and Distribution companies who entered into the shared purchase agreement with the Federal Government can only seek the intervention of the latter when sufficiently justified.
435,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-19 19:23:00+00:00,"The power sector has been privatized as we all know, but it has not delivered. We gave them our common patrimony and they still came back to us as Distribution Companies (Discos) and Generating Companies (Gencos) to look for money from the public."
436,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-19 19:23:00+00:00,This review in my estimation has become very necessary because the inefficiency of Power Generating and Distribution companies in the country has become very glaring. The exercise should either be reviewed or probably reversed.
437,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-19 19:22:59+00:00,"While giving the concluding remarks on a motion titled “Power Sector Recovery Plan and the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic,” on the floor of the Senate today, I called for the immediate review of the privatization exercise of the power sector by previous administrations. https://t.co/MMxKaArcPp"
438,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-12 17:32:20+00:00,We want to see a situation where the limited resources that are appropriated for NDDC are prudently and transparently deployed for the development of the region. This is our mindset and we will not shy away from our responsibility at anytime we feel that this is not happening.
439,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-12 17:32:19+00:00,But we have a mindset and our mindset in the Senate is that we have to have a Niger Delta Development Commission that is effective and efficient in service delivery to the people of Niger Delta. This is the essence of setting up that Commission.
440,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-12 17:32:17+00:00,"I must emphasis that we have no predetermined position on the outcome of this investigation as an institution. Issues raised are allegations, therefore the NDDC has the opportunity to come forward and defend its position."
441,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-12 17:32:16+00:00,"We are in total support of the President's directive for the forensic audit of the finances of the NDDC, and this is, in some way, complimentary to that directive."
442,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-12 17:32:15+00:00,"The investigation is being carried out by the Senate to complement the ongoing forensic audit which was ordered by the Federal government, as it would avail the management of the Comission an opportunity to defend the allegations against it."
443,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-12 17:32:13+00:00,"Earlier today, I inaugurated a seven-man adhoc committee to investigate the alleged financial recklessness in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) with a view to unravel the true state of affairs at the commission. https://t.co/36z5d8Tcij"
444,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-12 17:22:40+00:00,"As the world marks the International Nurse Day today, I want to use the opportunity of the celebration to particularly thank all Nigerian nurses and other frontline workers in the fight against #Covid19. You’ll are the true heroes and we can never thank you enough. https://t.co/ORKVMxhOCD"
445,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-12 17:07:03+00:00,"I think it is very important that citizens do this because it is for our sake. Government cannot be without citizens, and it is important at this point that we do this for our sake and that of our family members."
446,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-12 17:07:01+00:00,"This is a very serious health challenge to our country, but beyond interstate, even the observance of social distancing, hygiene and other protocols sometimes suffer inside the states."
447,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-12 17:06:59+00:00,"Apparently, there is so much breach, and it appears like our security agencies who are supposed to enforce this, in most cases appear to look helpless. They need to sit up."
448,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-12 17:06:58+00:00,"In my remarks after the prayers of the motion was adopted, I emphasized the need for security agencies to ensure a total enforcement of the ban to curtail the spread of the disease."
449,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-12 17:06:56+00:00,The Senate today debated a motion sponsored by Senator Ike Ekweremadu on the need to enforce the Presidential Order banning Interstate Movement as a result of the #Covid19 pandemic. https://t.co/wjfSSj7SDM
450,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-03 19:17:00+00:00,I urge them to continue to stand for and uphold the truth and fairness without fear or favour in the practice of their profession.
451,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-03 19:16:59+00:00,"For the world to win the battle against COVID-19, journalists too must not only be appreciated as frontline workers, they must have access to relevant information to enlighten the people on how to surmount the emergency."
452,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-03 19:16:58+00:00,The media has a very significant role to play in the current health emergency by feeding the public useful information about the Coronavirus pandemic.
453,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-03 19:16:58+00:00,"Although, the advent of the social media poses a challenge to the traditional media but they can turn this into an advantage by sticking to their training and the ethics of the profession."
454,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-03 19:16:57+00:00,"The theme for this year's celebration: ""Journalism without fear or favour"" is quite relevant in the light of the challenges facing the profession and the entire world."
455,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-03 19:16:56+00:00,I want to assure the stakeholders in the Journalism profession in Nigeria that they have a pillar of support in the ninth National Assembly for the advancement and practice of their noble profession.
456,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-03 19:16:56+00:00,"This day is specially set aside to highlight the heroic contributions of journalists to human struggle for justice, peace and development and Nigerian journalists in particular should be proud of their frontline roles in nation-building and entrenchment of democracy in Nigeria."
457,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-03 19:16:55+00:00,A hearty congratulation to Nigerian journalists and all the stakeholders in the profession as they join their colleagues all over the globe to mark this year's World Press Freedom Day. https://t.co/OswiRtvlNg
458,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-01 05:21:55+00:00,"I urge the Nigerian workers, as they mark their day, to adhere strictly to all the prescribed public health protocols of social distancing, wearing of face mask, use of hand sanitizer, observance of personal hygiene, and to endeavour to stay at home and stay safe."
459,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-01 05:21:42+00:00,"This year's celebration of Workers' Day comes at a time the entire world is facing the health emergency brought about by the Coronavirus pandemic, but the resilience and never-die spirit of the Nigerian people will boost the efforts of the government to overcome the pandemic."
460,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-01 05:21:32+00:00,"We have in the same respect made critical amendments to some laws to ensure smooth implementation of the budget. The Legislature would continue to move relentlessly in that direction, despite the unforeseen challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic."
461,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-01 05:21:12+00:00,"As part of the effort of the ninth National Assembly to strengthen the economy and improve the standard of living of the people, it is determined to make the country's financial year predictable and this we have began to do with the timely passage of the 2020 budget."
462,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-01 05:20:41+00:00,"As a legislature, we are ever ready to work in collaboration with the organised labour Unions to rid our statute books of any anti-labour laws."
463,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-01 05:20:39+00:00,The best way to appreciate the enormous contributions of the Nigerian workers is to always consider their welfare as of utmost importance.
464,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-01 05:20:38+00:00,I congratulate them for sustaining their heroic struggle for the liberation of the country from poverty and underdevelopment even in the face of the daunting challenges at various work places.
465,DrAhmadLawan,2020-05-01 05:20:34+00:00,"Today, I felicitate with Nigerian workers as they join their counterparts the world over to mark the Workers' Day. https://t.co/6kCa34SHm2"
466,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-28 16:15:41+00:00,"We are confident that we shall soon overcome this crisis, like previous health emergencies. All hands will however have to be on deck to register a quicker and more resounding success."
467,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-28 16:15:40+00:00,"We have been working with the executive on areas of adjustments for a more realistic implementation, and our resumption today will lead to a quicker resolution of some of our decisions."
468,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-28 16:15:39+00:00,"The pandemic has affected our budget for this year, not just because of falling oil prices, but also because it has forced a reduction in economic activities, leading to an enormous loss of revenue."
469,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-28 16:15:38+00:00,"We pray Almighty Allah will give their families the fortitude to bear the loss and grant them paradise. It is our prayers that we shall be able to mitigate the continuous spread of the virus, so we can regain our normal life and stay with the onerous business of nation building."
470,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-28 16:15:36+00:00,"This pandemic has killed thousands of citizens across the world. We have also lost many of our dear compatriots, one of them the Chief of Staff to President Buhari, Mallam Abba Kyari. We condole with the president on the painful loss, just as we mourn other citizens who have died"
471,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-28 16:15:35+00:00,The Senate convened today to enable us to sustain work on solutions and to ensure that the health crisis does not create further problems that might be much more difficult to deal with.
472,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-28 16:15:34+00:00,"We will continue in our efforts in the interest of our good health, the well-being of our people and the sustainable development of our nation."
473,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-28 16:15:33+00:00,"Although, our sessions were interrupted, we were able to sustain our interventions and collaborations with other arms and agencies of government in the concerted bid to mitigate the damage from the pandemic."

476,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-23 18:48:07+00:00,I wish us all Happy Ramadan. May Allah accept our sacrifice of self-denials and answer our supplications and prayers.
477,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-23 18:48:07+00:00,"As we embark on the spiritual journey in this Holy month of Ramadan, it is essential that we always keep to the directives on restriction of movement, social distancing, regular washing of hands and personal hygiene which are all necessary measures to stop the spread of COVID-19."
478,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-23 18:48:06+00:00,It is an important duty of the faithful during the Ramadan to show compassion for the less-privileged whose conditions have even been made worse this time by the economic and social disruptions caused by the Coronavirus pandemic.
479,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-23 18:48:06+00:00,We should also pray for divine guidance for our leaders to always take the right decisions and do the right things especially in this trying time for the comfort and well-being of the people.
480,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-23 18:48:05+00:00,I also urge us to remember in our prayers our health workers and other care givers who are at the front line of the fight against COVID-19.
481,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-23 18:48:05+00:00,We should therefore seize the opportunity to pray for the protection of our country and mankind in general against this plague and for a quick return to normal life.
482,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-23 18:48:04+00:00,"Therefore, as we enter the holy month, I urge the Muslim community and Nigerians in general to maintain full compliance with the directives given us by the relevant government and religious authorities in the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19."
483,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-23 18:48:04+00:00,"These are part of the sacrifices we have all been called to make, so that we can prevail against the ruthless invisible enemy called COVID-19."
484,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-23 18:48:03+00:00,"This also affects the ""I'tikaf"", the usual seclusion in the mosques during this period, which we have been advised to instead observe in our homes."
485,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-23 18:48:03+00:00,"As part of the measures to combat the pandemic, governments across the globe have directed people to keep social distance and avoid large gatherings, including congregation for lectures or prayers which are some of the dominant features of the holy month of Ramadan."
486,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-23 18:48:02+00:00,This year's Ramadan comes at a most unusual time when mankind is contending with an existential threat in the form of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic that has shut down the economy and entire social life throughout the world.
487,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-23 18:48:01+00:00,"My Ramadan Message to Nigerians 

I heartily felicitate with Nigerian Muslims on the commencement of the Holy month of Ramadan.

Observance of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam and it is a special period for seeking the face of Allah through fasting and prayers. https://t.co/7rxf7zx6pJ"

Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, PhD, CON,

President of the Senate and

Chairman of the National Assembly

Sunday, 19th April, 2020"
489,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:27+00:00,"A great tribute to his memories will be to sustain this understanding and make it reflect in quality performance of government and service delivery to Nigerians.

Adieu Mallam Abba Kyari. May Almighty Allah grant his soul Aljannah Firdaus. Amin."
490,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:27+00:00,"I believe that the good understanding between the two arms in the current dispensation has a lot to do with the kind of advice Mallam Kyari, a pillar in the government, and likeminded officials are giving the President with respect to our legislative business."
491,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:26+00:00,But he believed that there should always be a point of convergence of views for progress to be made and for the sake of the people we both represent.
492,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:26+00:00,"Mallam Kyari’s door was always open and provided an effective communication platform for the two arms of government. He appreciated that it is unavoidable to sometimes disagree on issues, after all, disagreement is part of human relations."
493,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:25+00:00,"On all such occassions, he was always patient and respectful, never even remotely resembling the caricature coldly portrayed in sections of the media of a vicious power monger. Never."
494,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:25+00:00,"For the topmost presidential aide to personally deliver such message, no doubt, demonstrated the desire of his principal for the two political arms of government to be on the same page, and understand each other’s perspectives on issues of national interest."
495,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:23+00:00,He deployed his administrative skills and natural patience to ensure that the two arms work in tandem and in partnership for the overall benefit of Nigerians.
496,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:23+00:00,"Mallam Kyari appreciated the desire of the ninth National Assembly to work with the Executive in an atmosphere devoid of unhelpful suspicions and bickering, and which does not compromise the integrity and independence of either arm or denude their roles."
497,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:22+00:00,"This should cause no surprise, as he was a lawyer, a journalist and an administrator par excellence. He quickly saw the point of the Federal lawmakers’ objective, and typically deployed his energy and influence to achieving it."
498,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:22+00:00,"How far we have come in this direction with respect to the Executive Arm has much to do with Mallam Kyari availing his office and person as a communication bridge, out of his own convictions too that effective communication makes issues clearer from all sides of view."
499,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:21+00:00,"A cardinal objective of the ninth National Assembly, which we declared from the outset, is to build a mutual understanding of roles, cooperation, partnership, with the other arms of government to enhance performance by government and general public service delivery."
500,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:20+00:00,"and eyes firmly fixed on the larger picture of the policy objectives and development agenda of his friend and principal. He did this until his last minute in service, until his death."
501,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:20+00:00,"This he did with constructive passion, based on his great administrative skills, consummate understanding of governance and power relations..."
502,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:19+00:00,"Mallam Kyari leveraged his office and good standing with his principal, President Muhammadu Buhari, to engender a cordial working relationship between the two elected Arms."
503,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:19+00:00,This tribute is largely about his role in fostering mutual respect and understanding between the Legislature and the President he served with uncommon loyalty and dedication as a trusted principal aide and Chief of Staff.
504,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:18+00:00,"Much has been written and much more will appear about a man who was blessed with so much talent, and used it to distinguish himself in his many service stations in the public and private sectors and at different levels of government."
505,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-19 13:59:18+00:00,"Mallam Abba Kyari died on Friday 17th of April, 2020 at the age of 67 years. The patriot died the way he would have preferred, at the very front line of service, sadly seized by a plague against which he was defending his beloved fatherland, Nigeria."

507,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-18 09:58:21+00:00,"Mallam Kyari played his role well and will always be appreciated, more so now that the Almighty Allah has called time on his earthly sojourn.

I pray that Allah will accept his soul into Aljannah and comfort all who have been left in grief by his passage."
508,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-18 09:58:20+00:00,He shared the values of President Buhari and his passion for the emancipation of the poor in Nigeria and the all-round development of the country for the benefit of all its people.
509,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-18 09:58:19+00:00,"Until his death, he was very deep, firm, focused and unassuming in his national assignment.

He was a man of deep convictions and courage who understood his role and performed it with uncommon dedication and effectiveness."
510,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-18 09:58:19+00:00,"Mallam Kyari drew from his experiences as a lawyer who was called to the Bar in 1983, a banker and a journalist to become an administrator par excellence who did his best as the topmost aide of the President."
511,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-18 09:58:18+00:00,"The news of Mallam Abba Kyari’s death, a very competent, dedicated and loyal aide, who was a pillar in the Buhari administration came to me yesterday with shock and sadness."
512,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-18 09:58:17+00:00,"My heartfelt condolences to family of Late Mallam Abba Kyari, President Muhammadu Buhari and the Government and people of Borno State over the passage of the deceased. https://t.co/DLubFAcrXJ"
513,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-18 02:39:28+00:00,"Inna Lillahi wa Inna Ilaihi Raji’un! Death is inevitable, it only comes at our individually appointed time. May Allah forgive the shortcomings of late Mallam Abba Kyari and grant him speedy passage to Aljannatu Firdausi."
514,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-17 14:28:03+00:00,I sympathise with those injured in the inferno and commiserate with the Government and people of Borno State over the tragic incident. I hope that relevant authorities will investigate the incident with a view to averting a re-occurrence.
515,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-17 14:28:02+00:00,"I also want to use this opportunity to commiserate with the victims of the fire incident that occurred on Thursday at a camp housing Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Ngala, Borno State, resulting in the death of 14 persons."
516,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-17 14:28:02+00:00,I urge Nigerians to continue to cooperate with the authorities as they strive to defend the country against the deadly virus.
517,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-17 14:28:01+00:00,Any officer found culpable of unprofessional use of weapons should as a standard practice be made to face prosecution.
518,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-17 14:28:00+00:00,"While I condemn in strong terms the actions of this high-handed security officers, I call for a  thorough investigation of the cases and that those indicted be promptly brought to account."
519,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-17 14:28:00+00:00,"Extra-judicial killings, in whatever guise, should be discouraged in our society. It is a tragedy that those asked to enforce compliance with emergency measures adopted for public safety are now being accused of the needless and totally avoidable deaths of citizens."
520,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-17 14:27:59+00:00,I am saddened by the report by the National Human Right Commission (NHRC) that 18 persons were killed by high-handed security officers tasked to enforce the stay-at-home directives against #Covid19
521,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-14 20:57:45+00:00,"At a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari earlier today, where we discussed issues of national importance including the fight against #covid19 and the palliatives to cushion the effects of the pandemic. https://t.co/AlfBqHnf9E"

525,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-10 19:36:12+00:00,The National Assembly will continue to provide legislative intervention to support and improve the efforts of Government in this trying period and beyond.
526,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-10 19:36:11+00:00,I salute the resilience of Nigerians and urge us all to continue to cooperate with the Government as it leads us in the fight against Coronavirus and its deleterious effects on the economy and life in general.
527,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-10 19:36:11+00:00,"We should not allow the frightening reports from other parts of the world on the pandemic to discourage us or weaken our hope. Rather, such reports should remind us of the Divine mercy under which we live in this clime, and strengthen our determination to rout this virus."
528,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-10 19:36:10+00:00,"Therefore, let us be fervent in our prayer for Divine intervention to vanquish the pandemic, heal the sick and renew the world and Nigeria."
529,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-10 19:36:10+00:00,My belief is that this is a passing phase for Nigeria and the entire world and that our faith is a potent spiritual weapon for the pursuit of victory.
530,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-10 19:36:09+00:00,"However, if we draw the right lessons from the death of Jesus on the cross at Calvary and his resurrection, we become more confident as we fight coronavirus  and all other trials that today test our faith."
531,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-10 19:36:08+00:00,This occasion is relevant today more than ever before as mankind passes through one of the darkest clouds in history.
532,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-10 19:35:48+00:00,"I heartily felicitate with Nigerians, particularly of the Christian faith, as we and the rest of the world celebrate Easter, a very important event in the calendar of the followers of Jesus Christ.

Easter marks the triumph of Jesus Christ over sin, adversity and death. https://t.co/gcPE35oXDb"
533,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-08 15:50:38+00:00,We must ensure that these Interventions have very clear and definite measurable targets. We shouldn't just throw money out there and then we don't see anything because the National Assembly will ensure that it monitors every single Kobo if and when the proposal is endorsed.
534,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-08 15:50:37+00:00,"So there is the need for the Federal Ministry of Finance and the CBN to have their intervention streamlined in such a manner that what someone loses under the stimulus package of the Federal Ministry of Finance, he gains in the stimulus package of the CBN."
535,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-08 15:50:36+00:00,"In our last meeting, the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning indicated very clearly that the Executive is proposing a N500 billion stimulus package. While this is a very good proposal, we must not duplicate what is already in the 2020 budget."
536,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-08 15:50:35+00:00,Also very important as I informed the committee is the need for relevant agencies of government to ensure that they streamline their activities along the provisions in the 2020 budge and to avoid needless duplication of projects.
537,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-08 15:50:34+00:00,The Senate President also tasked the relevant agencies of government to ensure that they streamline their activities along the provisions in the 2020 budge and to avoid needless duplication of projects.
538,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-08 15:50:33+00:00,"Infact, some of our states have been in a very difficult situation before the outbreak of Coronavirus and such interventions will definitely help."
539,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-08 15:50:32+00:00,"""We must ensure that there is equity. That there is fairness in the interventions. Every part of this country should have something to ameliorate the situation whether it is Coronavirus infected or not."
540,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-08 15:50:30+00:00,I told the presidential committee at the meeting to ensure equity and fairness in the distribution of the stimulus package and to ensure also that all parts of the country is considered in the intervention initiatives.
541,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-08 15:50:29+00:00,At the heart of all these facts is the various intervention initiatives of the Federal Government to mitigate the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on Nigeria.
542,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-08 15:50:28+00:00,"At yet another meeting with the Presidental Committee on COVID-19 today, the National Assembly leadership was presented with all the facts regarding the the current situation on Nigeria's crude oil and the amendment being contemplated as regards the MTEF and 2020 budget. https://t.co/hBrRx6GjGR"
543,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-07 16:55:29+00:00,So we are putting on our thinking cap and work out some strategies on how to identify the poorest persons in Nigeria. I think we have not been able to reach far out there to get them properly captured.
544,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-07 16:55:28+00:00,"We need to be better in terms of strategy for delivery and definitely, what we have been doing in the past cannot deliver exactly what will solve the challenges of the most ordinary and most vulnerable Nigerians."
545,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-07 16:55:27+00:00,"Now with Coronavirus, they need our attention more than ever before. The time has come that we review the ways and manner we use to deliver the services under the SIP to Nigerians."
546,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-07 16:55:26+00:00,It is my believe that the poorest of the poor have not been sufficiently captured by the programme and this is why we are intervening by working together with the Executive so we can reach much more of these people who are in serious distress even before the Coronavirus.
547,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-07 16:55:25+00:00,"But majority of those who are supposed to benefit have no access to power. They have no access to Internet. They have no bank account, so no BVN. Infact, many of them don't have phones and these are the poorest of the poor. Yet, some of the conditions inadvertently leave them out"
548,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-07 16:55:24+00:00,"We are concerned about the conditions and guidelines for the intervention programmes which are specifically directed at the most vulnerable Nigerians, requiring them to go online, through the internet or use their BVN to access the interventions."
549,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-07 16:55:23+00:00,The National Assembly is very much interested in the current Intervention initiatives of the ministry particularly with respect to the disbursement aimed at assuaging the plight of the poorest of the poor Nigerians against COVID-19.
550,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-07 16:55:21+00:00,"But from all that I have seen and heard in the past days, there is no doubt that the scheme needs to be reformed and backed by an enabling legislation in line with global best practices to make it more efficient and effective."
551,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-07 16:55:20+00:00,"This particular meeting is very important because over the past couple of days, I have been inundated with questions regarding the implementation of the Social Investment Programme of the Federal Government, many of which I do no have answers for."
552,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-07 16:55:18+00:00,"Today, we met with the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq, against the backdrop of the ongoing intervention initiatives aimed at reducing the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on the most vulnerable Nigerians."
553,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-07 16:55:17+00:00,The leadership of the National Assembly under my chairmanship today continued its engagement with key members of the executive arm of government with a view to addressing the impact of #Covid19 pandemic in the country. https://t.co/0iRQ0GgZDB
554,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 17:34:46+00:00,"Such interactions are critical because we are in an emergency and time is of essence. So, we must work as expeditiously as possible to ensure that we put in place the things that will make life meaningful for Nigerians."
555,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 17:34:38+00:00,"Going forward, we need to interact more because very fundamental decisions will need to be taken, and these decisions can only be said to be constitutionally legal if the legislature gives its stamp of authority for the executive to implement and execute."
556,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 17:34:35+00:00,"For instance, we have to redefine the implementation of the Social Intervention Programme. Going out to communities to give them N20,000 per person might not be the best way to go. It is still an effort, but I think we need a better approach that will be more efficient."
557,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 17:34:33+00:00,"Details of these according to the minister would be brought to the National Assembly for consideration. When this is done, we are prepared on our part to take and expedite necessary actions to ensure that we are able to provide succor to the people."
558,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 17:34:32+00:00,There is also the aspect of the fund proposed to be used to take care of special Public Work Programmes currently being implemented by the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) for the purpose of creating jobs at this critical time.
559,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 17:34:32+00:00,"The minister has told us what the plan of the Executive is, particularly in establishing a N500bn COVID-19 Crisis Intervention Fund which will be channeled into upgrading our healthcare facilities both at the national and states level as well as provide intervention for states."
560,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 17:34:29+00:00,This is indeed a clear testimony of what we have said we’ll do as it helps us to better perform our roles as legislatures especially in this time of crisis.
561,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 17:34:27+00:00,"This meeting, the second in the series after we shut down the National Assembly for two weeks, is a follow-up to one the leadership held last week Wednesday with members of the Presidential Committee which was set up for the management of the COVID19 crisis."
562,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 17:34:25+00:00,"In line with our earlier promise to provide support as the need arises in this time of #Covid19, the leadership of the National Assembly, today met with the Minister of Finance and her team to discuss ways of addressing the impact of the pandemic. https://t.co/HxD44qgrmV"
563,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 07:45:21+00:00,"I join his family, friends and political associates in celebrating him on this joyous occasion and pray for continual deepening of his wisdom and renewal of his strength for continued service of his beloved fatherland. Happy birthday Comrade."

565,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 07:45:20+00:00,"The life of the former comrade Governor has been that of struggle for the improvement of society, especially of the living conditions of the common Nigerians. This is clearly evident in his glittering records as a labour leader, Gov. and now the captain of the ship of our party."
566,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 07:45:19+00:00,"I congratulate him on his good health despite the intensity of his life of service to Nigeria as a former labour leader, two-term Governor of Edo State and in his current position as the National Chairman of Nigeria's governing party."
567,DrAhmadLawan,2020-04-04 07:45:18+00:00,"I rejoice with the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), His Excellency, Adams Oshiomhole, on the auspicious occasion of his 68th birthday. https://t.co/mXQ5hLqeMA"

580,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-25 18:36:05+00:00,It is no longer news that the outbreak of coronavirus and the drop in international oil prices has impacted on the global economy and that of Nigeria. This means that all our projections are no longer feasible and needs to be reviewed in line with the current realities.
581,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-25 18:36:03+00:00,"Today, I led the leadership of the National Assembly to a meeting with some Ministers and Heads of agencies from the Executive arm of Government to brainstorm on the impact of Coronavirus pandemic and the falling oil prices on the Nigerian economy. https://t.co/6mmBkcgyaY"

589,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-19 18:35:11+00:00,@Gauriller There are other electoral act amendment bills before the senate seeking to achieve the quarantee of free and fair election. This particular one will ensure that voters are able to vote based on informed choices of what candidates have to offer.
590,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-19 18:29:21+00:00,"The bill, having passed second reading has been referred to the Senate Committee on INEC for further legislative work. We await the outcome of their work."
591,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-19 18:29:20+00:00,"So, I think we probably go the way of other countries, to have non-State actors, and independent people who will be the ones saddled with the responsibility of organizing and conducting the debate."
592,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-19 18:29:19+00:00,"I believe that INEC has enough responsibilities and to give them the responsibility again to organize this kind of debate, INEC being a government body, will cause some difficulty for people, especially in the opposition, in participating in such debates."
593,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-19 18:29:18+00:00,"As good as it is, my opinion on it supports the creation of a separate Commission that would be saddled with that responsibility, because it would not only reduce the burden on INEC, but secure the interest of opposition candidates who are expected to participate in such debates."
594,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-19 18:29:16+00:00,"Today, we deliberated on a bill seeking to empower the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to organize and conduct debates for all candidates into the offices of the President, Vice President, Governors and Deputy Governor of a State. https://t.co/pjvbN7YmJl"
595,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 20:29:39+00:00,"It has been a very difficult and monumental situation to ask and get those monies back to Nigeria even if you identify where they are. For a developing country, such resources are important and critical to our efforts in developing our country."
596,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 20:29:38+00:00,I also also urged the World Bank to assist Nigeria in the ongoing drive to repatriate the money looted by Nigerians and stashed in foreign banks.
597,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 20:29:37+00:00,I recall the promise made last year by President Muhammadu Buhari to take out 100million Nigerians out of poverty in ten years. I believe that this is possible because we have the ingredients and we have the friends who will help us. This is where the World Bank is also needed.
598,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 20:29:36+00:00,"At this time when Coronavirus, the global pandemic, is making it difficult to raise revenue for the implementation of the 2020 budget, this is the time Nigeria needs the World Bank and I spared no word in asking for their support."
599,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 20:29:33+00:00,"While responding to the reason stated as the purpose of their visit to my office, I urged the World Bank to come to the aid of Nigeria in her effort at poverty alleviation in the country."
600,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 20:29:32+00:00,"Earlier today, I received the New World Bank Country Director for Nigeria, Shubham Chaudhuri who led a delegation of the Bank officials on a courtesy visit to my office. https://t.co/VtjsylduxY"
601,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 16:19:13+00:00,I think the federal ministry of health should come up with a minimum standard. That standard shou ld be replicated in all the states.
602,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 16:19:13+00:00,"The second issue is for isolation Centres that state governments are doing. Many of our states, in fact, almost every state has established one isolation centre."
603,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 16:19:12+00:00,"Even those that have been established, we want to suggest that we continue to upgrade the standard, we don’t want anything to tamper with the standard requirement for those testing Centres to be very functional."
604,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 16:19:12+00:00,We are going to support it for those testing Centres to be provided in the South East and in the northern part.
605,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 16:19:11+00:00,"So, I believe the federal government is supposed to do that, and we as an Assembly are prepared to support them if the request is for resources."
606,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 16:19:11+00:00,"So, the entire north has no testing Centre, and when you have this situation, you need to take immediate action to test and confirm, whatever it is."
607,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 16:19:10+00:00,"There is at the moment no testing Centre in the entire South East, at the moment, the entire north has no testing Centre, Abuja is federal capital territory."
608,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 16:19:10+00:00,"I believe that the federal government has done well, so far, but I think there is need for them to do a little more, and that is in the area of testing Centres."
609,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-17 16:19:09+00:00,"On the floor of the Senate today, we deliberated on a motion calling on Nigerians to observe the practice of prevention control against coronavirus, and I raised concerns on the unavailability of test centres in some geo-political zones of the country particularly the South East. https://t.co/HRGQMcZnX5"
610,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-16 20:07:30+00:00,"Earlier today in Okene, the home town of His Excellency, Governor Yahaya Bello to condole him on the loss of his mother, Hajiya Hauwau Oziohu Bello. May Allah grant mama Aljannatu Firdausi. https://t.co/cqYquEbnGv"
611,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-15 20:39:24+00:00,My prayer is for God to comfort all those who are affected hoping that the relevant authorities and agencies will get to the root of the incident with a view to forestalling a recurrence.
612,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-15 20:39:23+00:00,I also commiserate with the Lagos State Government over the tragic incident and sympathize with those who are injured and those who lost property to the inferno.
613,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-15 20:39:21+00:00,"I received with sadness, the news of the explosion that occured this morning at Abule Ado in Amuwo Odofin Local Government Area of Lagos State. I commiserate with the victims and condole with all those lost loved ones in the incident. https://t.co/rP26N6XQ03"
614,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-14 19:51:23+00:00,"A hearty congratulations to, Abubakar Ya’u, whose fish in the fishing contest weighed 78kg and went home with a cash prize of N1millon, a car and a trip to Mecca for Hajj."
615,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-14 19:51:22+00:00,"I commend the governor of the state, His Excellency, Alhaji Atiku Bagudu for not just the courage to revive the festival but the giant stride he has recorded in the agricultural sector especially in terms of rice production."
616,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-14 19:51:22+00:00,"The revival of the fishing festival which was already drawing international tourists from different parts of the world before its suspension is an indication that the fight against insurgency is succeeding, and I have no doubt that subsequent ones will be even better."
617,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-14 19:51:21+00:00,"Earlier today, I graced the grand finale and closing ceremony of the repackaged Argungu International Fishing and Cultural Festival. I am delighted that the event which was halted many years ago due to the insurgency in the region has been revived. https://t.co/2CcnlWatux"
618,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-10 17:33:54+00:00,"This Joint Committee will continue to engage with people in government, as well as people outside of government, so as to be abreast with all necessary information. It will also engage with the Ministry of Finance and National Planning, and any other Ministries that we need to."
619,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-10 17:33:53+00:00,"Therefore, we feel that as a parliament, we need to be proactive and up-to-date with the situation, so that we are also able to take a decision when it matter for us to do so, hence the constitution of the joint committee."
620,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-10 17:33:52+00:00,"When we passed the Fiscal Strategy Paper and Medium Term Expenditure Framework, and subsequently the budget, we benchmarked the price of oil at $57 per barrel. Today, that price has crashed to $31 USD or there about, and we don’t know where this will stop."
621,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-10 17:33:52+00:00,"You may be aware that the spread of the dreaded Coronavirus (COVID – 19) disease has led to the crash of several markets across the world, and seeing that the economy of our country depends rightly on the export of crude, it is only proper that we act promptly."
622,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-10 17:33:50+00:00,I have today constituted a Joint Committee to engage the Executive arm of government on measures to be taken to insulate the Nigerian economy against the impact of the sudden crash of crude oil price globally. https://t.co/489nVZ5sEa
623,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-10 17:16:20+00:00,"Therefore, it is our responsibility to do whatever we can to ensure that they are enrolled in primary and secondary schools and I am happy that we have began move and onwards doing that today."
624,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-10 17:16:19+00:00,"It is no longer news that the number of out-of-school children is a big challenge facing Nigeria as a nation, as it constitutes not only social but security problems to the country as a whole."
625,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-10 17:16:13+00:00,"Today, the Senate deliberated on a motion on the Need to Integrate Almajiri Education into Modern System of Education in Nigeria, so as to reduce the number of out of school on the streets."
626,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-09 20:29:21+00:00,"I want to thank all those who took out time to attend the public hearing today for being open minded, dispassionate and providing the listening ears to hear the other side. Together, we shall find an agreeable way forward."
627,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-09 20:29:19+00:00,"Today, the Senate provided the platform for all shades of opinion to be aired. That opinion will help the committee to reach its final decision. The decision of the senate therefore will be partly dependent on the Committee’s report."
628,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-09 20:29:18+00:00,The way we have engaged each other at the public hearing is the same way that we must continue to seek ways of addressing the excesses and limitations that are a consequence of the abuse of ‘freedom’.
629,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-09 20:29:17+00:00,"It is in the spirit of ensuring the protection of these rights that the Senate referred the bill to its Committee for legislative work, so as to get the input of all concerned Nigerians and I am happy to hear that we achieved this today."
630,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-09 20:29:16+00:00,"The rope between the freedom of an individual and the limits of that individual is often a tight one to walk. As a people however, we cannot stop discussing this freedom and its limitations for peace and harmony, growth and development."
631,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-09 20:29:14+00:00,I agree that matters of freedom of speech and the inalienable rights of man are issues we should not compromise. I also agree that the right of an individual ends where the rights of another individual begins.
632,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-09 20:28:58+00:00,"But like every other innovation, it has had its positive and negative sides. While it has somewhat made communication easier, faster and even cheaper, it has also affected our ability to easily trust some information."
633,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-09 20:28:58+00:00,"We in the National Assembly understands that freedom of speech and the inalienable rights of man are issues which should not be compromised under any guise. We also understand that the Internet has become central to our lives, as it has reshaped how we live, work and interact."
634,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-09 20:28:57+00:00,"During my speech, I emphasized that the National Assembly would not arrogate to itself the power of exclusively passing the social media bill into law without inputs from Nigerians."
635,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-09 20:28:44+00:00,"Today, I declared open a Public Hearing on the Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulations Bill, also known as the Social Media Bill, presently under consideration by the National Assembly. https://t.co/NF2SaNU2bc"

637,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-08 07:59:22+00:00,"Individually and collectively, we must take responsibility and play our part in mobilizing to realise the rights of women. Let’s make this year count for women and girls everywhere around the world. Happy International Women’s Day. #Each4Equal"
638,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-08 07:59:21+00:00,Today presents another opportunity for us to reflect on every issue that bothers on the rights of women across generations and throughout the world. It is no longer a luxury or privilege. It is a must.
639,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-08 07:59:20+00:00,"Over the years and not withstanding their roles as the cornerstone of the society, we have not just underrated and undervalued the work of women, we have also downplayed their significance in building our economy and our communities."
640,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-08 07:59:18+00:00,"Today is International Women’s Day and this year’s theme, “I am Generation Equality: Realising Women’s Rights,” #Each4Equal underscores the need for people of every gender, age, race, ethnicity, religion and country to galvanise and drive actions in promoting the rights of women. https://t.co/rt0mA7IAm9"
641,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-08 05:16:03+00:00,On this special day of yours dear @ProfOsinbajo I wish you many more years of great accomplishments and good health. Happy birthday.
642,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-08 05:16:02+00:00,He has also shown exceptional loyalty in government and dedication to his duties with a demonstration that one can actively participate in politics at the highest levels and yet maintain personal integrity and high reputation.
643,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-08 05:16:01+00:00,"Professor Osinbajo has brought his diverse experience as an erudite lawyer, distinguished scholar, revered clergyman and political leader to bear on his role in government."
644,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-08 05:16:00+00:00,"As Vice President Yemi Osinbajo clocks 63 today, I join his family, friends and associates in celebrating him especially for being a great Nigerian leader and role model. https://t.co/7ihCcGNowY"
645,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-05 19:51:47+00:00,It is our hope that this loan will turn around the economy of Nigeria and bring some positive influence on the Gross Domestic Growth (GDP) of this country. This is the more reason why we are going to be responsible that it is we’ll utilized.
646,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-05 19:51:46+00:00,"I want to assure Nigerians that as a Chamber of the National Assembly, we will be responsible and ensure that no funds approved here are utilized for something else or used in uneconomic or imprudent manner."
647,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-05 19:51:46+00:00,Our Committees must be prepared to ensure that no single dollar or cent is spent on any other thing outside of what has been indicated in the approval.
648,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-05 19:51:44+00:00,Our responsibility is to ensure that the executive arm of government strictly apply the fund to the relevant projects and this we are going to do by tasking Committees of the National Assembly to strictly supervise them.
649,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-05 19:51:42+00:00,"Today, the Senate unanimously approved President Muhammadu Buhari’s $22.79b loan request to fund critical infrastructure projects in the country. Beyond this approval however is the need for the National Assembly to ensure that the fund is spent on the projects they are meant for"
650,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-05 06:11:33+00:00,"I recall his pivotal roles at different epochs in the tasks to keep Nigeria one, stable, democratic and prosperous. I pray that he continues to be an asset for nation-building in Nigeria and the emancipation of Africa. Wishing him many more years of good health."
651,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-05 06:11:32+00:00,"Chief Obasanjo has made indelible contributions to the unity and development of Nigeria in over five decades at the vanguard of nation-building. He has served his country with courage, wisdom and sense of history."

653,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 19:17:30+00:00,The Senate committees on Health will come back tomorrow there tomorrow to ensure that the temporary isolation Centre is fixed while work continues on the permanent one which has been promised would be completed by the end of the month.
654,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 19:17:29+00:00,"Let’s spend money for our people, we waste money for some things that are less important. This is about the health and lives of the people of this country, and therefore, no investment is too much."
655,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 19:17:27+00:00,"I also believe that while we push for the completion of the permanent site in the university premises, we should have a replication of same in five other places across the remaining geo-political zones of the country."
656,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 19:17:26+00:00,"Therefore, we are going to get across to the Minister of Finance and all the other authorities that have anything to do with this to release this money latest tomorrow."
657,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 19:17:25+00:00,"I am sad, that of the N620 million that was supposed to be released to this place for fixing of everything at the isolation centre to NCDC, not a kobo has been released. The fact that we don’t already have cases here does not mean we should not be prepared."
658,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 19:17:24+00:00,"There’s no way that Nigeria, the largest economy in Africa, with a population of two hundred million, and yet the federal capital and six surrounding states of the North Central, you don’t have one room that you can call an isolation Centre."
659,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 19:17:23+00:00,"There’s no generator, no electricity, nothing. There were only two or three air conditioners brought in this morning, perhaps because we said yesterday that are going to visit the place. That is absolutely not acceptable. https://t.co/qSYtf703P8"
660,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 19:17:19+00:00,"From the tour of facilities we undertook, the temporary isolation center is really not in good shape and doesn’t look ready to receive any patient, while the permanent one is yet to be completed. https://t.co/mo9oO6bORL"
661,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 19:17:14+00:00,"Although, we met a team of Staff from the Ministry of Health, NCDC and the management of the Teaching Hospital who are in high spirit, looking determined to discharge their mandates and obligations, others doesn’t show our readiness. https://t.co/7Sq4IgeDbW"
662,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 19:17:10+00:00,"As earlier promised, this afternoon, I led a delegation of the leadership of the Senate on an oversight visit to the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, where a temporary Isolation Centre and another one undergoing construction are located. https://t.co/utnZbmszTN"
663,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:26+00:00,"All we are trying to do is to ensure that we reduce the gap, that we create a platform for understanding, that we are able to pass laws much more easily and of course, make Nigeria a better place by so doing."
664,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:25+00:00,I must however clearly state that the existence of this committee will not in any way take away that responsibility of the National Assembly to critically scrutinise anything that the Executive brings to the National Assembly.
665,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:24+00:00,"We believe the interaction, the consultation will ensure that any possible grey areas in the bill that emanates from the executive will be addressed before the final form of that bill."
666,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:23+00:00,"But with this new arrangement, so much consultations between the Executive and the Legislature will precede the process of any Bill, be it an executive bill or private-member bill."
667,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:22+00:00,We have had some experiences that were not too good in the past when bills will be passed and the executive would have some reasons not to assent to the bills or bills would come from the executive arm of government and the Legislature will think otherwise.
668,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:21+00:00,"On the Executive-Legislative Committee, we have set up the committee so that the ninth National Assembly will do things differently with respect to law making and with the participation of the executive arm of government."
669,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:20+00:00,"Today, I will be paying a visit to the FCT isolation centre being constructed in Gwagwalada to see the level of work done."
670,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:19+00:00,"For now, only the one in Lagos is standard and functional. So we need more of such centers, because in a period of emergency like this, we don’t need to wait until it happens. Even if we eventually don’t use them, they will remain useful in the future."
671,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:18+00:00,"The ministry however must see to the urgent establishment of more isolation centers across the country. Personally, I feel that we; the Federal Government, should provide such centers, at least one in each of the six geo political zone."
672,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:17+00:00,One thing we learnt from the briefing is the need for Nigerians not to panick but rather comply with the preventive guidelines issued by the ministry and ignore the unfounded stories about the disease.
673,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:16+00:00,"The minister and the other officials thus briefed us on the measures taken by the ministy, NCDC and other relevant agencies to check the spread of the disease."
674,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:15+00:00,As members of the National Assembly representing Nigerians it is only appropriate that we engage with them and know the level at which our country is ready to prevent the disease from harming any Nigerian or indeed anyone within the confines of our boundaries.
675,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:13+00:00,"The leadership of the Senate had invited the Minister of Health and officials of the centre to brief us on the preparedness of the country to contain Corona Virus, so that lawmakers can also be a part of the campaign and response to the disease."
676,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:10+00:00,The second is the inauguration of the Executive/Legislative Committee set up with the intent of making passage and assent of bills by the legislature and the executive respectively more easier.
677,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-04 06:11:06+00:00,"Yesterday, I had two engagements that I consider very critical in our quest to deliver good governance to Nigerians. The first is the meeting we had with the Minister of Health and officials of the National Centre for Disease Control."
678,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-02 17:20:31+00:00,"We pray that this death that has brought so many together will continue to unite people, and of course, this country."
679,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-02 17:20:30+00:00,"We met him only in 2019 when we went to the Senate, but he was already an accomplished human being, not only in terms of what he was able to achieve in public service, but in terms of what he was as a person."
680,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-02 17:20:29+00:00,"Longjan, who was buried today will be greatly missed. This is one loss that is for all of us, this country will miss him. He was one gentleman that made a difference."
681,DrAhmadLawan,2020-03-02 17:20:28+00:00,"Earlier today, I was in Jos, Plateau state to attend the funeral church service of my departed colleague, late Senator Ignatius Datong Longjan. https://t.co/tqqcTxcQXm"

685,DrAhmadLawan,2020-02-29 07:11:43+00:00,"Although, I have always felt welcome in Nguru, this traditional title of the Mukaddam of Nguru is a confirmation of my acceptance as a son of not just Nguru, but the entire Nguru emirate."
686,DrAhmadLawan,2020-02-29 07:11:42+00:00,"The traditional title according to the letter of conferment is for my “recognition, dedication, competency, hardwork, honesty, commitment, transparency and selfless service to Yobe North Senatorial zone, Yobe state and the nation at large.”"

688,DrAhmadLawan,2020-02-27 18:25:00+00:00,I believe that FIG should consider Nigeria's candidate for the post considering the large number of Surveyors in the country which surpasses the numbers for other African countries put together.
689,DrAhmadLawan,2020-02-27 18:24:33+00:00,The event afforded me the opportunity to make a strong case for Nigeria's candidate contesting the vice presidency of the Federation Internationale Geometric (FIG).
690,DrAhmadLawan,2020-02-27 18:24:32+00:00,"As a graduate of Surveying myself, I know how elated the 344 new surveyors are on their induction today. It is on that premise that I congratulated them and admonished them to see their induction as a call to service."
691,DrAhmadLawan,2020-02-27 18:24:32+00:00,"I want to once again thank SURCON for the double honours, and I assure them that whatever I have done to qualify me for it, the award will inspire me to do more."
692,DrAhmadLawan,2020-02-27 18:24:31+00:00,"It was not only awarded to me, it was instituted in my name as the “Distinguished Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan Award for Development of Surveying and Geoformatics Profession in Nigeria,"
