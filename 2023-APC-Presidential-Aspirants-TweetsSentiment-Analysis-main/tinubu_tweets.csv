6,officialABAT,2019-12-17 17:27:52+00:00,"4. “A man of political courage, you have taken bold decisions that those before you knew were needed but avoided taking. You have made Nigeria safer by making the violent terrorists and wrongdoers so much weaker that..."
7,officialABAT,2019-12-17 17:27:52+00:00,"3. As president,you have done much to correct our national direction and to place us on the pathway to our better future.Your administration has been one of momentous achievement and the realization of hope and progress for our country and our party,the All Progressives Congress"
8,officialABAT,2019-12-17 17:27:51+00:00,"2. Throughout your public life you have shown yourself to be a man of hard work, dedication and principle. 

“You have exhibited that rare combination of a simple and modest lifestyle coupled with an ambitious and grand vision for our nation."
9,officialABAT,2019-12-17 17:27:51+00:00,"1. Tinubu Congratulates Buhari at 77:

Joining the rest of the country, I extend my best wishes to President Muhammadu Buhari on his birthday. This special day gives us an opportunity to personally thank you for the contributions you have made to the development of our nation."
10,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:57+00:00,"25.
7. Whatever you do or wherever you are, maintain your integrity and good name. They will serve you more than riches.

Thus, today, we bid farewell to a man with such a name and who lived with such integrity. For this, he shall always be remembered."
11,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:56+00:00,"24. 
5. An individual will be remembered for the impact he made in the lives of the people, for his contributions to socio-econ development.
6. There are leaders and there are leaders, but only those who make a big difference will be entitled to the positive judgment of history"
12,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:56+00:00,"23. 
3. We should rededicate our lives to the agenda of progress by laying a good foundation for future generations.
4. Leaders at all levels should realise that power is neither served a la carte nor can one hold office forever."
13,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:55+00:00,"22. What should the present generation learn from the deceased Lagos patriot?
1. Government must be dedicated to public welfare to earn the support of the people.
2. We should always promote the tradition of democratic inclusion."
14,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:54+00:00,"21. These pioneer civil servants, particularly the four musketeers, -Act. Sect to Government A.E. Howson-Wright, Acting Financial Sect Mr. F.C.O. Coker, Legal Secretary M.I.O. Agoro and Principal Secretary J.O Adeyemi-Bero- left indelible marks in the Lagos State Civil Service."
15,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:54+00:00,"20. The civil service is critical to an effective and efficient administration. Hence, the governor did not make a false start. He went out for the best technocrats who he attracted from the Federal Civil Service, Western State Civil Service and universities."
16,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:53+00:00,"19. ...Justice Teslim Elias, Chief Fagbeyiro Beyioku and Chief Femi Ayantuga. Under his leadership, these elders contributed their expertise and experience, to the wellbeing and progress of Lagos State."
17,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:52+00:00,"17. Not only must the government carry people along in its people-oriented activities, it must seek the benefit of a robust feedback from the very people who are the intended beneficiaries of meaningful programmes."
18,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:52+00:00,"16. That approach to governance is still relevant till today, particularly under the democratic setting. A democratic government cannot be aloof. Neither can it achieve desired success through alienation of critical stakeholders."
19,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:51+00:00,"15. Where others might have used a heavy hand, Pa Johnson employed tact and wisdom for governance in a challenging terrain. Governor Johnson promoted the culture of inclusiveness through his wide and painstaking consultations with eminent Lagos elders and traditional rulers."
20,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:51+00:00,"14. Traditionally, military governors were deployed to fledging states to rule by force. But, the young governor was not indifferent to the consciousness, complexity and sophistication of heterogeneous Lagos."
21,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:50+00:00,"13. Yet, since he did not plan to fail, he did not fail to plan. The greatest assets of a given society are its human resources. It was a credit to his administration that as its head, he made people the central focus and indeed, the cornerstone of his administration."
22,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:50+00:00,"12. As a pioneer, the then youthful and promising Lieutenant-Colonel Johnson had no predecessor to emulate. As he reflected in his memoirs, he had to start with ""a clean sheet"" as there was no manual or past record of state governance to refer to."
23,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:49+00:00,"11. He had embraced soldiering as a career, taking after his father, who fought in the Second World War. Little did he guess that he would be catapulted to the corridor of power. At 31, Johnson was appointed as military governor of Lagos State by Gen. Gowon on May 31, 1967."
24,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:49+00:00,10. He was one of the finest officers that have worked with me and I am proud of the achievements that we together recorded for Lagos State. The youths of today have many virtues to learn from Pa Johnson.
25,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:48+00:00,"9. As attested to by his Commander-in-Chief, Gen. Yakubu Gowon, Johnson’s ""courage and success in the military and later, in governance and business have been remarkable and brought him the admiration we have for him."
26,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:48+00:00,"8. Brigadier-General Mobolaji Olufunso Johnson laid a durable foundation, which his successors, both military and civilians, have continued to build upon in the city-state of Lagos. His hard work, discipline and sense of purpose were legendary."
27,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:47+00:00,7. He quietly offered constructive advice to successive administration in Lagos without playing to the gallery. He was a man of courage and this made him a man of peace.
28,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:47+00:00,"6. In the twilight of his life, the first military governor deliberately kept a low profile. He shunned controversy, unlike some of his peers who revel in highly partisan inflammatory statements."
29,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:46+00:00,"5. We recall the courage, the firmness and wisdom of decision-making, the sense of accommodation of stakeholders, the extra-ordinary emotional intelligence in power, the foresight, creativity, and the calmness of a benevolent soldier-administrator in moments of crisis."
30,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:46+00:00,"4. who left good legacies in public service. We mourn no doubt. But, more importantly, we rejoice over the evergreen landmarks of the pioneer administrator who, at its formative stage, made the Centre of Excellence a reference point."
31,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:45+00:00,"3. We celebrate a servant-leader, an incorruptible elder-statesman who refused to use the corridor of power as an avenue for private accumulation. We salute a gallant officer who did not compromise the ethics of military professionalism and an epitome of discipline..."
32,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:44+00:00,"2. We converge to honour a man of integrity who made history as the first military administrator, and later, governor of our beloved state. We bid an officer and a gentleman farewell."
33,officialABAT,2019-12-03 19:15:44+00:00,"1. Tribute to Late Brigadier-General Mobolaji Olufunso Johnson: An Officer and Gentleman Goes Home

We gather today to pay tribute to an icon of Lagos State."
34,officialABAT,2019-11-19 15:39:26+00:00,"2. I’m deeply saddened by the death of Umar Pariya. I knew him very well. He was very cerebral. An excellent human being, Umar Pariya had a welcoming and accommodating spirit. May his soul rest in the bosom of the Lord."
35,officialABAT,2019-11-19 15:39:25+00:00,"1. My condolences to Vice President Atiku Abubakar over the loss. May VP Atiku, family, friends and associates of the late Pariya find the strength to live through this sudden and untimely demise."
36,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:51+00:00,17. They have done their part; the two governors must now do theirs by providing good leadership and progressive governance to their people.
37,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:51+00:00,"16. Their task is never easy.  They deserve praise for overseeing well-organised elections. Above all, I commend the people of Kogi and Bayelsa who came out to perform their civic duty and express their sovereign will in a clear and decisive manner."
38,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:50+00:00,"15. Violent behaviour must not be allowed to impede our path to greatness as a democratic nation. I also commend all INEC officials involved for conducting fair, free and credible elections."
39,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:50+00:00,14. We sympathise with the victims and commiserate with the families of those who lost their lives. I enjoin law-enforcement authorities to identify those responsible for perpetrating the violence and levy the full force of the law against them.
40,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:49+00:00,13. I condemn the scattered incidents of violence witnessed in the election in some parts of Kogi State. Election should celebrate our democratic existence. Never should election be occasioned by loss of life.
41,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:49+00:00,13. I urge the opposition candidates and politicians in Kogi and Bayelsa to rally round their governors and work together in the interests of their two states.
42,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:48+00:00,"12. He must take advantage of the state’s agricultural richness as well as its proximity to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja and the commerce resulting from that closeness."
43,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:48+00:00,"11. The governor must focus on the development of the state as he is the person, more than anyone else, who will determine the fate of Kogi. He must do all he can to realise the potential of the state."
44,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:47+00:00,"10. For Governor Bello, the people of Kogi have handed him a second term. Their vote is proof of the confidence that the people of Kogi retain in his leadership. He must now re-double his efforts to do even more for the people in his second term."
45,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:47+00:00,9. They too must be gracious in defeat. The governor must be a leader for all and work for all Bayelsans irrespective of party affiliation.
46,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:47+00:00,8. He must carry along all disparate interests in the state and be magnanimous in victory. Let him reach out to the political opponents who mounted a spirited and energetic campaign.
47,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:46+00:00,7. Bayelsa is endowed with significant natural resources and human capital. It will be incumbent on the Governor-elect to harness these assets for the good of all Bayelsans.
48,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:46+00:00,"6.  With this victory, Governor-elect Lyon’s task is to justify the people’s faith by providing a purposeful and transformational administration."
49,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:45+00:00,"5.  By voting APC, the people of Bayelsa have voted for progressive reform and Asiwaju joins them in their belief that David Lyon is the man to deliver the needed and desired reform."
50,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:45+00:00,4. It shows that the people have no appetite to return to the failed policies and practices of the past. David Lyon’s election represents a significant shift in the politics of Bayelsa State.
51,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:44+00:00,"3. Their victories stand as testament to the growing acceptance of our party, the quality of our leadership and governance and the credibility of our promise to lead the people and the nation to the Next Level."
52,officialABAT,2019-11-18 17:21:44+00:00,2. The outcome of these elections shows that the people believe in the direction that President Buhari and the APC wish to take this nation. The electorate has faith in the progressive reforms our party envisions.
53,officialABAT,2019-11-15 19:42:31+00:00,10. May the soul of Chief Akinyele find eternal rest in the bosom of the Lord.
54,officialABAT,2019-11-15 19:42:30+00:00,9. My condolences also go to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and the government and people of Ondo State.
55,officialABAT,2019-11-15 19:42:30+00:00,"8. I mourn with his professional colleagues, the Public Relations practitioners and members of the Nigeria Institute of Public Relations."
56,officialABAT,2019-11-15 19:42:29+00:00,"7. My thoughts are with his family, friends and relations at this moment. May they find the strength to live through his passing."
57,officialABAT,2019-11-15 19:42:29+00:00,6. He was full of life. He was unmistakable with his sartorial elegance.The country he did his best for will sorely miss him.
58,officialABAT,2019-11-15 19:42:28+00:00,5. Chief Akinyele radiated warmth and tenderness. To meet him is to like him.
59,officialABAT,2019-11-15 19:42:28+00:00,"4. He was also one leader who was very proud of his Yoruba, indeed Ondo heritage, and demonstrated this often in his appearance and conduct."
60,officialABAT,2019-11-15 19:42:28+00:00,3. He did his best as Minister of Information and later Chairman of the Nigerian Sports Commission.
61,officialABAT,2019-11-15 19:42:27+00:00,2. Chief Alex Akinyele was an elder statesman. He served the country to the best of his abilities.
62,officialABAT,2019-11-15 19:42:27+00:00,"1. Condolence for Alex Akinyele’s Family, Professional Colleagues."
63,officialABAT,2019-11-09 21:43:25+00:00,"8. “And the Hereafter will be better for you than the first life.

And your Lord is going to give you and you will be satisfied”.

“Ma Salam.”"
64,officialABAT,2019-11-09 21:43:24+00:00,"7. We pray that Allah in His Infinite mercy continue to support you, bless your family and all the things you cherished.

For the Almighty Allah says in Qur’an 93 Verse 3-5 thus:

“Your Lord has not abandoned you nor detested you,"
65,officialABAT,2019-11-09 21:43:24+00:00,"6. As you age gracefully, we pray that Allah continue to keep you in good health and continue to grant you His blessings.

At 80, my prayer for you is as follows:"
66,officialABAT,2019-11-09 21:43:23+00:00,5. Our country is lucky to have you at this particular time. I’m highly honoured and privileged to know you because knowing you is a wonderful thing.
67,officialABAT,2019-11-09 21:43:22+00:00,"4. A man of great character, you have been a resourceful pillar of support for our president, Muhammadu Buhari. Many have rightfully described you as imbued with immense talents, your character, however, remains an inspiration to me in particular."
68,officialABAT,2019-11-09 21:43:21+00:00,"3. You are a reputable veteran journalist, successful entrepreneur, a nationalist and an Islamic faithful who has made important contributions to this country. Indeed, you have done a lot for our country."
69,officialABAT,2019-11-09 21:43:21+00:00,"2. Your life is a study in high integrity, humility and discipline. An extremely private person who hardly talks about himself, your accomplishments, however, speak highly of you."
70,officialABAT,2019-11-09 21:43:20+00:00,"1. Mamman Daura at 80
At 80, you are of sound mind, sound health, in high spirit and remain as brilliant, radiant and quick-witted as you have always been. Alihamudulilai. We are grateful to Almighty Allah for this and we pray for many more years for you."
71,officialABAT,2019-11-05 23:00:00+00:00,"21. The end result will be an economy transformed into one that provides hope, opportunity and meaningful livelihoods for all.

Indeed, we move toward a New Deal for Nigeria."
72,officialABAT,2019-11-05 23:00:00+00:00,"20.  It will do so with an eye to reforming what needs to be reformed and improving what needs to be improved. Just as the oil sector has been made better, all other sectors of the economy will be strengthened."
73,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:59+00:00,"19. The amended Deep Offshore Act is not an isolated, solitary act. It is a harbinger.Just as the amended Act brings to the oil sector overdue reform that will benefit national development, the Buhari administration will take a critical look at all major segments of the economy."
74,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:59+00:00,"18. ...and policy. Along with his ministers and other officials, the EAC will offer the president their best professional advice on how to improve all aspects of the economy and government’s role in it."
75,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:58+00:00,"17. President Buhari is intent on reforming the economy that it may answer the needs of the majority of our people.  Establishing the Economic Council of Advisers (EAC) was an innovative, bold step, assembling our nation’s top economic minds to shape economic programmes..."
76,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:58+00:00,"16. He had to grapple and make headway with these fundamental problems before shifting primary focus on economic reform. As the title of Chief of Staff Kyari’s composition indicate, we now move toward a New Deal for Nigeria."
77,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:58+00:00,15. President Buhari first had to tackle insecurity and the terrorism of Boko Haram. He then had to throttle corruption in official circles so that government could be responsive to the people’s needs instead of serving those who enriched themselves from government coffers.
78,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:57+00:00,14. Such beneficial reform is what the Buhari government seeks but in a more complex and challenging environment. The American challenge was exclusively economic. The Nigerian challenge is multi-faceted.
79,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:57+00:00,"13. In so doing, he would reform, at times reinvent, the nation’s economic institutions and laws. This would change the relationship between the average citizen and the American government for the better. This was the essence of the New Deal."
80,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:56+00:00,"12. Faced with steep economic challenges, the administration of Franklin Roosevelt dedicated itself to reforming the economy in order to bring prosperity to a hurt and struggling population."
81,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:56+00:00,"11. ...principled leader to steer the nation out of danger. No two historical situations are identical. But, there are important similarities between our circumstance and the challenges America faced during that period."
82,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:56+00:00,"10. The people would vote to remove the austere, insensitive party that had governed the nation for over a decade simply by catering to the wealthy. The people voted for a compassionate, progressive government headed by a committed..."
83,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:55+00:00,9. Chief of Staff Kyari titled his commentary “Toward a New Deal for Nigeria.” This is appropriate and more than symbolic. The title recalls a challenging time in the history of the United States. That nation was in the throes of economic contraction.
84,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:55+00:00,"8. This time, finally, the national interests were considered weightier than the special interests of a few. President Buhari and the National Assembly leadership should be commended for this singular achievement."
85,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:54+00:00,7. The amendments demonstrate the important progress to be made when the National Assembly and the Presidency work in harmony for the collective good. Efforts by past governments to amend the law got bogged in failure due to the intervention of special interests.
86,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:54+00:00,"6. The companies are Nigeria’s long-term business partners and we have no interest in denigrating them; all we seek is a fair, equitable relationship. The new amendments provide this."
87,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:53+00:00,"5. This was no attempt to deprive the oil majors. We want the firms to make a just profit for their efforts; however, they have been receiving a surplus at the expense of our minimal developmental needs. This is not as things should be."
88,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:53+00:00,4. Billions of dollars that should have landed in our national coffers to fund public infrastructure and essential social services instead found residence in the balance sheets of the oil firms.
89,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:53+00:00,3. ...Presidential Chief of Staff Abba Kyari rightfully asserted the financial provisions of the old law had outlived their stated purpose. Continuation with this outmoded financial regime enriched the oil companies while depriving Nigeria of a fair bargain.
90,officialABAT,2019-11-05 22:59:52+00:00,"2. WITH the action by the National Assembly to improve the outdated Deep Offshore Act through legislative amendment, Nigeria has turned an important corner. As stated in his insightful, forward-looking commentary published in the November 1 edition of Thisday newspaper..."

99,officialABAT,2019-11-01 00:55:53+00:00,5. He was always available to advise and extend a helping hand to successive regimes in Lagos and particularly to me during my time as governor.
100,officialABAT,2019-11-01 00:55:53+00:00,"4. He contributed immensely to the state, developing the civil service. His tenure in Lagos also witnessed the building of major infrastructure in the state."
101,officialABAT,2019-11-01 00:55:52+00:00,"3. First military Governor of Lagos, Johnson embodied the true spirit of Lagos. He served Lagos with dedication and determination."
102,officialABAT,2019-11-01 00:55:52+00:00,2. Brigadier-General Mobolaji Olufunso Johnson who died on Wednesday at 83 was an important national statesman and one of the true fathers of Lagos.

General Gowon has continued with the task of engendering peace and unity in the land with the ‘Nigeria Prays’ project.
150,officialABAT,2019-10-18 17:47:09+00:00,"3. It’s on record that after the civil war, General Gowon propounded the ‘No Victor, No Vanquished’ policy aimed at bringing about national reconciliation, which thrives on his personal influence."
151,officialABAT,2019-10-18 17:47:09+00:00,2. Nigeria owes General Gowon a debt of gratitude for his efforts at resolving ethnic tensions that threatened to fatally divide the country and for his continued and untiring efforts at building One Nigeria.

This failure was not from lack of trying; the failure was because such evidence simply does not exist. President Buhari won the election openly and honestly."
170,officialABAT,2019-09-13 11:08:40+00:00,"14...The Court, on the other hand, can only deal with facts at hand not the imaginings of the mind. Most importantly, the Court found that the election was properly conducted and that President Buhari won by the wide margin counted and recorded by INEC."

Without those who stoutly stood on June 12 and sacrificed life let us renew our commitment to utilizing democracy as a vehicle for eliminating poverty in our land as well as providing prosperity and life more abundant for the teeming millions of our people.
267,officialABAT,2019-06-11 20:59:33+00:00,"9. Observing May 29 as democracy day delinks the country’s democratic experience since 1999 from the protracted and bitter struggle against military dictatorship from June 12, 1993, till the forced exit of the military in 1999."

292,officialABAT,2019-04-21 23:21:16+00:00,"45. To be beneficial, politics must be tied to the greater purpose of governance such as with President Buhari’s goal to reform the national economy for the good of all Nigerians."

301,officialABAT,2019-04-21 23:21:11+00:00,36. This is all Asiwaju has hoped to achieve. There are no ulterior motives. Everything he has done is in concert with and in furtherance of the wishes of President Buhari and the party.
302,officialABAT,2019-04-21 23:21:10+00:00,"35. “If we are truly committed to optimal governance, then we also must be equally committed to ensuring that the National Assembly leadership be competent and experienced as well as imbued with a progressive mindset and a desire to work in close cooperation with executive."
303,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:48+00:00,"24. Joining forces with President Buhari and others who shared his progressive ideology, he helped form the APC. Since the inception of the APC, Asiwaju’s focus has been to assist President Buhari develop,"
304,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:47+00:00,"23. “What afflicts them does not affect Asiwaju. Since he last held public office, Asiwaju has, with unprecedented success, dedicated himself toward building a political party that would furnish a progressive alternative to the regressive policies of the PDP."
305,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:47+00:00,"22. Perhaps because these people have nothing to contribute regarding statecraft or providing actual solutions to actual problems, their minds remain forever mired in political machinations."
306,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:46+00:00,21. They merely reveal what these people would do if they were Asiwaju. But they are not him and thankfully he is not motivated by the same selfish designs that fuel such people.
307,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:46+00:00,"20. These peddlers of tales do not know the measure of the man nor can they understand what motivates him. Thus, they project their own petty ambitions and designs on to him. The rumors reveal more about the mongers than they say about Asiwaju."
308,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:45+00:00,"19. “This track record does not evince a man obsessed with power and office. While the intrigue-mongers seek to depict Asiwaju as a man hungering for position, his deeds speak of something else."
309,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:45+00:00,"18...Asiwaju, uniquely in Nigerian politics, has foregone his personal ambitions as his political ideas and policies have flourished in the hands of his allies and mentees."
310,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:44+00:00,"17. Where others, upon leaving one office, tend to set their eyes immediately upon another,"
311,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:44+00:00,"16. “If you were asked to name another political figure who has exercised such forbearance, you would be hard pressed to identify another person with a comparable record when it comes to restraint in seeking office."
312,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:43+00:00,15. Asiwaju has not run for elected office since 2003. He last held office in 2007. He has never vied to become chairman of the APC nor has he tried to insinuate himself into any major government office.
313,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:43+00:00,14. “This attempt to caricature Asiwaju as if his words and actions are all aimed at grabbing power will fail because this portrait distorts the plain truth. While the headlines are sensational they are also senseless because they are not grounded in fact.
314,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:43+00:00,13...in the service of the nation instead of in the service of political intrigue and gossip mongering our country would be much the better.
315,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:42+00:00,12. They also seem to have acquired the unique gift of bending time so that 2023 appears before we even reach the midway point of 2019. If these people would only enlist their uncanny talents...
316,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:42+00:00,11. “The peddlers of these rumors have arrogated to themselves the preternatural ability to read Asiwaju’s mind more than he himself can know it.
317,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:41+00:00,10. This is why they reelected in President Buhari while rejecting the horde of political jobbers that constitute the PDP.
318,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:41+00:00,"9. The people elect those who they believe will be the best public servants, committed to the national wellbeing."
319,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:40+00:00,"8. “However, the Nigerian people do not elect politicians to office simply to watch on as they maneuver and jostle for position at the next election."
320,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:40+00:00,7. these people want to skip ahead to the next election as if they can cast aside the next four years.
321,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:39+00:00,"6. is now preparing to lead the nation forward for the next four years. Instead of covering the President’s exciting Next Level agenda and what it promises in terms of economic and social growth &amp; development,"
322,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:39+00:00,"5. “Nigeria has barely emerged from President Buhari and the APC’s resounding victory in the last election. The President, with the support of an APC majority in both chambers of our National Assembly,"
323,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:38+00:00,4. It is for this latter reason that we find cause to speak out where otherwise we would have continued to watch on in silent amusement.
324,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:38+00:00,"3. Not only are these reports utterly false, based as they are in the febrile imaginations of those persons by whom they are being peddled, they are injurious to President Buhari’s historic quest to reform Nigeria."
325,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:37+00:00,2. The stories claim this supposed manipulation is the first salvo in Asiwaju’s effort to position himself for a presidential run during the 2023 election cycle.
326,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:37+00:00,"1. “We have monitored, with rising incredulity, the rash of news stories claiming Asiwaju Tinubu is manipulating the APC nomination process for the National Assembly leadership."
327,officialABAT,2019-04-21 22:54:36+00:00,TINUBU FOCUSING ON THE ISSUES OF TODAY: TOMORROW IS THE MASTER OF ITSELF
328,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:23+00:00,14. My prayer is that God grant the family the strength and grace to continue to contribute to the improvement of Lagos and Nigeria as our beloved Pa Fasinro would want them to do.
329,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:23+00:00,13. We take some solace in that Pa Fasinro left behind talented and able children who will carry on his progressive legacy.
330,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:22+00:00,"12. ""The country and Lagos greatly benefited from his wise counsel. Lagos and the nation shall miss him greatly. The Muslim Ulammah in Lagos, South-west and indeed Nigeria will deeply miss him."
331,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:22+00:00,"11. ""Pa Fasinro believed that local government councils were training grounds for future leaders at the state and federal levels and he worked hard to turn this wise belief into practical reality."
332,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:21+00:00,"10. ""Regarding further reorganisation of the council, Pa Fasinro was a strong ally and wise adviser when I spearheaded creation of additional councils in the state to accelerate economic development in Lagos."
333,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:21+00:00,9. Pa Fasinro was Lagos Town Council Clerk when that Council was an administrative unit of Lagos created under a new Local Government Law in succession to the council created by the 1941 Ordinance.
334,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:20+00:00,"8. ""Pa Fasinro was an important factor in the political and traditional histories of Lagos.  On the political and administrative fronts,"
335,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:20+00:00,"7. ""He was elected to the Senate under the Unity Party of Nigeria, a progressive party that is one of the ideological precursors of the Alliance for Democracy, Action Congress of Nigeria and All Progressives Congress."
336,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:20+00:00,"6. ""Whether as the first Clerk of the Lagos City Council or Senator representing Lagos State, he gave his best. Pa Fasinro truly served Lagos to the best of his abilities. As such he shall always stand as an example to all of us."
337,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:19+00:00,"5. A devout Muslim, he committed himself to the betterment of humankind and the history of his life bears the fruits of his selfless devotion to the people."
338,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:19+00:00,"4. ""He contributed immensely to Lagos and Nigeria as a lawyer, politician, administrator, legislator, author, and community leader."
339,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:18+00:00,3. He believed in the innate goodness of the people and that democratic governance would help our people realize their fullest potentials.
340,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:18+00:00,"2. ""A committed progressive, Papa fought to establish the rule of law and to give Lagosians a democratic egalitarian society."
341,officialABAT,2019-04-01 19:19:17+00:00,"1. ""Alhaji Hassan Adisa Fasinro was a true father of Lagos. Born and bred here, he personified the best of Lagos and dedicated his life to making Lagos a place of progressive governance, cultural richness and social justice for all its people."
342,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:27+00:00,"25. Thank you for this wonderful birthday present you have given me. I have been enriched and energized by the intellectual exchange. I hope that you have too. Now, let’s move on to the Next Level.
 
Asiwaju Bola Tinubu.

Final- March 28 1500"
343,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:26+00:00,24. Let it be that all may live in social contentment and tranquillity with his neighbour as well as with himself. This is what we mean by the Next Level.
344,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:26+00:00,23. Government funded social security for the aged and government backed affordable housing and mortgage facilities are things we must continue to explore in an aggressive manner.
345,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:25+00:00,22. We must applaud President Buhari for the historic innovations made in the agricultural sector. We must further encourage him to do even more.
346,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:25+00:00,"21. INFRASTRUCTURE:
Government should continue to aggressively implement its national infrastructure plan."
347,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:24+00:00,"20. POWER:  
I believe the second Buhari administration will work to increase electricity generation, transmission and distribution by more than 50 percent within the next 4 years."
348,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:24+00:00,19. The single most important sector for the government’s focus is infrastructure. The most important of our infrastructural demands is power. This has been the greatest discovery of humanity in the last thousand years.
349,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:23+00:00,"18. To pull the nation from poverty, government must play a decisive role. It must at times direct and even develop markets and opportunities. This is nothing novel."
350,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:23+00:00,"17. That would be tantamount to racing to live in a building just as its long-term occupants were frantically rushing out, screaming that the edifice was mean and crumbling.  If we are smart, we dare not enter."
351,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:23+00:00,"16. The Next Level must be seen as part of this global and historic dynamic.  
Our pursuit of the Next Level cannot be achieved by blindly following the economic path of other nations."
352,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:22+00:00,"15. Mr. President, you have warned several times that the storm that approaches is not inevitable. It is born of a human folly and reckless greed. This means that it can be rectified by human wisdom and prudential action."
353,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:22+00:00,14. Forecasters are predicting a global recession within the next 12-18 months. We must recognize these harsh economic tidings as advance warnings to the wise. Hence we must think deeper and work harder for our people in Nigeria.
354,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:21+00:00,12. This truth is particularly acute when these very nations now face fundamental political and economic questions that cast doubt on the social utility and viability of the economic model under which they have travelled for the past 50 years.
355,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:21+00:00,"11. However, to achieve durable progress, we can’t afford to work hard but in mindless devotion to the ways of other nations."
356,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:20+00:00,"10. In this process, it is tempting and easy to borrow indiscriminately from those nations that seem to have mastered the art of democratic governance and to have achieved economic prosperity."
357,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:20+00:00,"9. It has a much deeper and more profound meaning, perhaps even more than its authors contemplated. This is because we are a nation still in the process of defining itself politically and economically."
358,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:19+00:00,"8. You see, Next Level is not just a trendy campaign phrase to be quickly discarded once victory has been achieved."
359,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:19+00:00,7. You have enhanced our democratic and economic discourse at a moment when such public discussion is greatly needed.
360,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:18+00:00,"6. I commend the Vice President, my dear friend, Professor Yemi Osinbajo, and his team for organizing another excellent Colloquium. VP Osinbajo and his team have done a fine job bringing us together again this day."
361,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:18+00:00,"5. Here I must also thank our dear First Lady Aisha Buhari for her zeal, support and commitment to the betterment of this nation. You are a true role model for women in Africa."
362,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:17+00:00,"4. Mr. President, you have gone far these past few years in laying a good foundation for the economic recovery of the country. We shall go farther still so that Nigeria truly reaches the next level with you leading the way."
363,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:17+00:00,3. Instead you chose to be here and to even give me the compound honor of accepting to be the Chairman of this occasion.
364,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:16+00:00,2. I want to thank President Buhari for sharing this special day with me. The pressure of affairs facing the leader of a nation is such that you could have easily found reasons why you could not participate.
365,officialABAT,2019-03-28 14:24:16+00:00,"1. WORK FOR THE PEOPLE
THAT THE PEOPLE MAY WORK FOR THEMSELVES"
366,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:54+00:00,"14. Any reports to the contrary are just the lies and mongering of those whose love and support for democracy are much less than his”.

Tinubu Media Office,
Tunde Rahman
March 19."
367,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:54+00:00,"13. He has been at the forefront of the struggle for electoral reforms, justice and equality over the years. He will never do anything that will detract from these fine ideals for which he has strenuously worked."
368,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:53+00:00,12. “Asiwaju is a committed democrat and advocate of free and fair electoral processes. He will neither support nor work to promote anything that will undermine or weaken the electoral system.
369,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:53+00:00,"11. If the people do so, then they would have voted in their best interests and that is for the APC, the party of President Muhammadu Buhari."
370,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:53+00:00,10. Kano has an enlightened electorate that will vote as they believe. Asiwaju hopes that they will disregard the lies and rumors about him and remain faithful to their progressive tradition.
371,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:52+00:00,"9. “Regarding the people of Kano, Asiwaju has nothing but the utmost respect and admiration. Kano has historically stood as a bastion of progressive politics. Its brand of politics helped inspire the establishment of the APC."
372,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:52+00:00,"8.  Instead, we rose to the occasion &amp; relied on our organic and positive relationship to the people.With regard to the impact these PDP operatives had in the Lagos election,let it be said that they came, they saw, they lost and they left with nothing in hand but another defeat."
373,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:51+00:00,"7. “These people did not call Atiku and others to order for interfering in Lagos. Instead, they urged Atiku and others to undertake this misadventure. The All Progressives Congress did not cry and lament that Atiku came to Lagos to swing an election that did not concern him."
374,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:51+00:00,"6. These people encouraged and cheered when former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and outgoing Senate President Bukola Saraki led a posse of Peoples Democratic Party figures into Lagos, boasting they were going to “capture Lagos” during the governorship elections."
375,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:50+00:00,5. The fear-mongers know the picture is old and was taken in Lagos. They still use it because their relationship to the truth is an adversarial one. Scratch a liar and you will find a hypocrite as well.
376,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:50+00:00,"4. “For the record, Asiwaju is not in Kano and has not been in Kano at any point during the conduct of these elections. The picture that these liars are circulating of Asiwaju and Governor Ganduje is one that was taken last year when the governor visited Lagos."
377,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:50+00:00,3...casting him as some type of one-man political invasion intending to unduly influence the governorship election.
378,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:49+00:00,"2. Politicians of this ilk are afraid to stand before the people on their own two feet. They use lies and deception as their crutch. Such is the case with the false stories of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu being in Kano,"
379,officialABAT,2019-03-19 20:52:49+00:00,1. “Weak and mean politicians turn to rumor and fear mongering because their true appeal to the people is limited and uncertain. These desperate operatives stir resentment of others as a way to get the support of the people.
380,officialABAT,2019-03-15 13:19:58+00:00,"11. “On its part, the government must fast-track demolition arrangements once a building is discovered to be weak and deserving of being pulled down to save lives.
“Above all, we must all take appropriate lessons and learn from this sad incident.”"
381,officialABAT,2019-03-15 13:19:58+00:00,"10. “If after the collapsed building had been found to be weak and marked for demolition, everybody had done what was required of them, perhaps this terrible incident would have been averted."
382,officialABAT,2019-03-15 13:19:58+00:00,"9. Government’s laid down regulations on building construction and maintenance must be faithfully respected and enforced. To mobilize support for these regulations, Community Development Associations need to come to government’s aid."
383,officialABAT,2019-03-15 13:19:57+00:00,"8. While we await the inquiry into the circumstances that led to the incident, we must all support government’s intervention efforts.
“The Lagos State Material Testing Laboratory for buildings must be strengthened and the officers must do their work."
384,officialABAT,2019-03-15 13:19:57+00:00,7. “I appeal to Lagosians to voluntarily donate blood not only to victims who urgently require blood but also to improve our blood bank in the state.
385,officialABAT,2019-03-15 13:19:57+00:00,6. “They do not deserve to die the way they did. May God comfort their families and grant repose of the souls of those young ones. Government must now ensure adequate medical treatment for the rescued victims.
386,officialABAT,2019-03-15 13:19:56+00:00,"5... “The building collapse in Ita-Faji, Lagos Island on Wednesday is a tragic occurrence. I commiserate with the families of those kids who lost their precious lives."
387,officialABAT,2019-03-15 13:19:56+00:00,"4. He said the government must fast-track demolition arrangement once a building is discovered to be weak and deserving of demolition to save lives.
In the statement signed by his Media Adviser Tunde Rahman, Asiwaju Tinubu said:"
388,officialABAT,2019-03-15 13:19:56+00:00,"3. In a condolence message on Thursday to the families of the victims, the APC leader said the school children lost to the building collapse did not deserve to die the way they did. He prayed for the repose of the souls of the innocent kids."
389,officialABAT,2019-03-15 13:19:55+00:00,2. The former Lagos governor said the government must now ensure adequate treatment for rescued victims. He also called on Lagosians to donate blood to the rescued victims.
390,officialABAT,2019-03-15 13:19:55+00:00,"1. All Progressives Congress (APC) Nation Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has commiserated with the families of victims of Wednesday’s collapse of a building in Ita-Faji, Lagos Island, saying the incident was tragic."
391,officialABAT,2019-03-15 13:19:54+00:00,"Lagos Building Collapse Tragic, Government Must Ensure Adequate Medical Treatment for Rescued Victims – Tinubu"
392,officialABAT,2019-03-05 12:51:52+00:00,"14.The relationship between them remains solid and loyal. And one hundred false reports by one hundred SaharaReporters cannot change that reality""."
393,officialABAT,2019-03-05 12:51:52+00:00,"13.""Asiwaju views Governor Ajimobi as highly disciplined and a committed and respected party leader, unlike some others who have no respect for party supremacy."
394,officialABAT,2019-03-05 12:51:51+00:00,12.Who can dare stop him? We want him in and at the rallies. Asiwaju’s intervention in Oyo was to engender genuine reconciliation. To exclude this good and able governor would have aborted this mission before it started.
395,officialABAT,2019-03-05 12:51:51+00:00,"11.""In addition to not having such a negative inclination, Asiwaju wields no such power and has no desire to have such power. Ajimobi is a sitting governor who can travel his state as he pleases."
396,officialABAT,2019-03-05 12:51:51+00:00,10.For SaharaReporters to claim this is to claim that Asiwaju is a political novice. Asiwaju has never barred anyone from participating in a campaign. Why would he now start with Ajimobi in Ajimobi’s own state?
397,officialABAT,2019-03-05 12:51:50+00:00,"9.""SaharaReporters betrayed its abject bias with this report. It makes absolutely no sense to even try to stop a sitting governor from campaigning in that governor’s state. Such a move would only create enmity and hinder, not help a campaign."
398,officialABAT,2019-03-05 12:51:50+00:00,"8.The truth is that Asiwaju is not trying to supplant or hide the governor. Instead, Asiwaju is lending his support to the governor’s and APC’s efforts in the state. They are partners not rivals."
399,officialABAT,2019-03-05 12:51:49+00:00,"7.""Moreover, Governor Ajimobi has been an excellent governor and a faithful member of the APC. He has brought progress to the state and in serving two consecutive terms, Ajimobi made history in Oyo. He is instrumental to anything the APC can achieve in Oyo."
400,officialABAT,2019-03-05 12:51:49+00:00,"6. The real truth is that SaharaReporters no longer cares if its reportage is right. SaharaReporters just cares that it is widely read. It dare not allow veracity to hamper its business model. This is a disservice to ethical journalism which honors truthful, accurate reporting."
401,officialABAT,2019-03-05 12:51:49+00:00,"5.This online newspaper no longer bothers to offer the pretense of seeking the truth. For SaharaReporters, whatever is sensational must be true and whatever is true must be sensational."
402,officialABAT,2019-03-05 12:51:48+00:00,"4.Thus, the writer has cast truth aside in his angry desire to inflict some kind of electoral wound on the APC.""

By doing so, this allows for the case to move forward without the CCT or others fearing the CJN might use his position to unduly interfere with proceedings.If the CJN is exonerated, then he will return to his position.If not exonerated, then a permanent discipline awaits him."
480,officialABAT,2019-01-29 18:10:35+00:00,"22. Nothing has been taken from the CJN that cannot be restored if the facts warrant such restoration. Thus, President Buhari conditionally suspended the CJN."

502,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:35+00:00,"20.However, for Atiku to state that the CJN should remain on seat while credible and grave charges swirl around him is to put the entire workings of the Supreme Court under a heavy cloud."
503,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:34+00:00,"19.Should the charges show themselves to be wrong or unproven, the CJN will be automatically reinstated as the head of the Nigerian judiciary."
504,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:34+00:00,18.What he has done is to have the CJN temporarily get out of his chair so that the serious matters against him can be heard by someone other than himself.
505,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:33+00:00,"16. Thus, your recourse to saying that the president violated the constitutional provision regarding the removal of a CJN is inaccurate in that Buhari never intended to remove the CJN."
506,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:33+00:00,"15. If justice was your goal, you would acknowledge that the CJN has only been temporarily suspended not permanently removed."
507,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:32+00:00,"14. Strange that you would choose to depict the current situation so inaccurately as to stir emotions unduly. You claim that CJN Onnoghen has been removed. However, this is not so. He has been temporarily suspended."
508,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:32+00:00,13. A few weeks ago in a televised broadcast you even revealed to the people that your official policy envisioned the base enrichment of your friends should you achieve the presidency.
509,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:32+00:00,"12. Regarding such a destructive love as this, I am sure democracy and fair elections would rather do without."
510,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:31+00:00,"11. Instead of repenting for rigging at least five states too many, your expressed regret was that you had not rigged enough; that you rigged one state less than the complete mauling of democracy your party and your principal had mandated."
511,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:31+00:00,10. Your love for democracy is such that you were recently observed apologising to the PDP for not rigging the Lagos 2003 gubernatorial polls as you did the polls in the other Southwestern states.
512,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:30+00:00,9. You also readily sacrificed the economic development and welfare of millions of innocent people in Lagos just to gain some illicit political advantage that proved to be fleeting and of no avail to you in the end.
513,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:30+00:00,"8. Instead, you gladly and without dispute joined Obasanjo in utter disregard for these unambiguous legal verdicts. In so doing, you demeaned the rule of law."
514,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:29+00:00,"7. When you lorded over Nigeria in tandem with President Obasanjo, there were myriad court orders mandating that your government render to Lagos state the funds due it to improve the lives of its millions of inhabitants."
515,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:29+00:00,"6. In his address, he claims the nation has entered a difficult moment. To my dear and good friend Atiku, I say the difficulty is not so much with the moment but with your memory."
516,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:28+00:00,5. His previous life of over seventy years was one of skirting democracy and of blatant impunity in attempting to enshrine reactionary government and installing an unjust political economy on the backs of the people.
517,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:28+00:00,"4. Did he even have the courage to visit his mentor, late Major General Shehu Musa Yar Ádua, in jail for fear of Abacha stopping him from running for the governorship of Adamawa?"
518,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:27+00:00,"3. “Where was he (Atiku), his voice and action during Abacha’s suffocating maximum rule? Was he not a member and cheer-leader of one of the five Abacha parties aptly described then as five leprous fingers of Abacha?"
519,officialABAT,2019-01-29 17:42:27+00:00,2. it will go down in political history as a classic of self-incrimination. Atiku thinks the piece exalts him. Instead it evinces his penchant for wilful misstatement that make him unfit for the office he now seeks and has always coveted.

531,officialABAT,2019-01-22 12:47:12+00:00,18.“He tried to convert our young democracy into a one party state. His PDP boasted that they would rule for 60 uninterrupted years. Never did they boast that they would govern us well during even one year of the sixty.
532,officialABAT,2019-01-22 12:47:12+00:00,17.There was no one who came into his company for any period of time with whom he did not fall out if he expresses a thought contrary to one of his.
533,officialABAT,2019-01-22 12:47:11+00:00,"16.“Instead of being a unifying figure as Commander-in-chief, he lowered himself to being a divisive, vindictive conniver. There was no table which he neared that he did not upset and overturn."

https://t.co/wo2HyB3nLw"
550,officialABAT,2019-01-08 12:35:47+00:00,22.We do this not for personal accolades. We do this not merely to reelect a party member. We do this because it is the best thing for Nigeria.
551,officialABAT,2019-01-08 12:35:47+00:00,"21.“Consequently, the members of the APC presidential campaign council accept our respective assignments as both high honor and heavy responsibility. We will work diligently to reelect President Buhari."
552,officialABAT,2019-01-08 12:35:47+00:00,"20.We should not reward him by giving him another eight years because the more he feeds, the stronger his hunger grows."
553,officialABAT,2019-01-08 12:35:46+00:00,19.“That government had so much money at its disposal and that is exactly what it did. It disposed of the money yet failed to treat the poor or build for the future. Atiku laid waste to the national treasury for eight long years. That is enough for one lifetime.
554,officialABAT,2019-01-08 12:35:46+00:00,18.Atiku had his chance to shine as VP when he controlled the privatization program of the Obasanjo government. He abused this assignment. He helped squander billions of dollars on power generation that did nothing but extend our national the darkness.
555,officialABAT,2019-01-08 12:35:45+00:00,17.“We cannot afford a President whose ways and mind is a maze of contradicting urges and colliding desires. This shows he has no vision for the nation and no guiding principles except the naked pursuit of power for the naked use of that power.
556,officialABAT,2019-01-08 12:35:45+00:00,"16.His compass has four needles pointing in different directions as the same time. He knows of no direction to take. President Buhari’s word is his bond. When Atiku speaks, it is to give you the slip."
557,officialABAT,2019-01-08 12:35:45+00:00,"15.“When Buhari says “yes” or “no,” you know where he stands. He means what he says, no more, no less. With Atiku things are more nuanced. When Atiku speaks, he may mean “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” I don’t know,” “come back tomorrow,” “all the above,” or “none of the above.”"
558,officialABAT,2019-01-08 12:35:44+00:00,14.“The character of the two candidates cannot be more distinct. President Buhari is a straight and honest man. Leave a naira on the table with Buhari in the room. You will find the naira on the table when you return.

605,officialABAT,2018-09-30 16:00:48+00:00,"14. From the common labourer, to business leaders, to professionals and our industrious civil service. We all were to be partners in a monumental but joint enterprise."
606,officialABAT,2018-09-30 15:59:53+00:00,"13.  Businesses, large and small, invested, hired millions of workers and thrived. All Lagosians were to fully participate and justly benefit from the social dividends and improvements wrought by this plan."
607,officialABAT,2018-09-30 15:59:04+00:00,"12. During my tenure and Governor Fashola’s, Lagos state recorded improvements in all aspects of our collective existence, from public health to public sanitation, from education to social services, from the administration of justice to the cleaning of storm and sewage drains."
608,officialABAT,2018-09-30 15:58:51+00:00,"11. The government of my immediate successor, Tunde Fashola, also honoured this enlightened plan. Where state government remained true to that blueprint, positive things happened."
609,officialABAT,2018-09-30 15:58:21+00:00,"10. Out of this collaborative effort, was born a master plan for economic development that would improve the daily lives of our people. Bestowed on me was the honour of a lifetime when I was elected to be your governor in 1999. My administration faithfully implemented that plan."
610,officialABAT,2018-09-30 15:57:45+00:00,"9. Roughly 20 years ago, a corps of dedicated and patriotic Lagosians, put aside personal interests and rivalries, to put their minds and best ideas together for the good of the state."

612,officialABAT,2018-09-30 15:56:50+00:00,"7. As democracy would have it, you shall be the authors of the party’s nomination and hopefully our next state government. I trust in the wisdom of the people and will abide it. However, as a leader of the party and as a former governor of our beloved and excellent Lagos,"
613,officialABAT,2018-09-30 15:56:24+00:00,"6. Something much greater waits in the balance. What is at stake is nothing less than the future of the people of this state and how we can best maximise our collective destiny. By resort to direct primaries, the party places the people’s future soundly in their hands."
614,officialABAT,2018-09-30 15:55:48+00:00,"5. We are democrats in the truest sense of the word. As such, we forever search for what is good and right for the people. With this ideal as our guide, tomorrow’s primary cannot be shaded by selfish ambition or the perceived personal grievance between this or that person."
615,officialABAT,2018-09-30 15:55:23+00:00,4. No other party in Nigeria dare attempt what we have already dedicated ourselves to do. I thank and commend all APC members and all Lagosians who have lent their support to this historic and humane mission upon which our party has embarked.
616,officialABAT,2018-09-30 15:55:02+00:00,"3. While our party is young, it has grown fast and has travelled far in a short time. This speaks well of the character of you, the party’s rank-and-file members. What, in other nations, has taken political parties generations to achieve, we have done in a few brief years."
617,officialABAT,2018-09-30 15:54:36+00:00,"2. With the holding of direct primaries to elect governorship candidates in Lagos and other states, the APC takes a groundbreaking step toward greater internal democracy and progressive governance for the benefit of all people."

622,officialABAT,2018-08-19 18:41:52+00:00,"11. If Saraki had remained in the APC, he would be unable to reclaim his Senate seat let alone the Senate Presidency. He thus bolted because he lusts for the presidency but was promised by the PDP, at least, a return to his position in the Senate”."
623,officialABAT,2018-08-19 18:41:43+00:00,"10. On Senate President, he said: “Much the same for Senate President Saraki. Returning to the PDP, he harbors dreams of the presidency but Tambuwal’s ambition will dwarf Saraki’s when the two collide."
624,officialABAT,2018-08-19 18:41:15+00:00,9. His exit had nothing to do with governance of the nation. It was about forging a personal ambition predicated on the defeat of progressive reform not the advancement of it”.
625,officialABAT,2018-08-19 18:40:56+00:00,"8. “But for the promise made by PDP headliners like Rivers State Governor Wike that he would have the PDP presidential nomination, Tambuwal would not have left."
626,officialABAT,2018-08-19 18:40:20+00:00,"7. However, he had not the stomach to challenge President Buhari in a primary. Tambuwal felt further insulted that he would be compelled to face a direct primary just to retain the governorship nomination."
627,officialABAT,2018-08-19 18:39:13+00:00,"6. Speaking specifically on the Sokoto governor’s defection, the APC leader said: “Governor Tambuwal’s exit can be distilled to one cause. He covets the presidency."
628,officialABAT,2018-08-19 18:38:45+00:00,"5. “Nigeria is undergoing a historic transition. Sometimes awkwardly, tentatively, yet inexorably, we nurture political and governance reform. We steadily close the door on the old malpractices that have caused a rich nation to reside in the tenement of the global poor”."
629,officialABAT,2018-08-19 18:38:17+00:00,"4. Asiwaju Tinubu asked the people to go beyond the debate on the numbers in the Senate of House of Representatives, saying “we must pull back from the shallow headlines to recognize that something fundamental is at stake."

631,officialABAT,2018-08-19 18:36:49+00:00,"2. Asiwaju said on Sunday in Lagos that the defectors wanted automatic tickets and sharing of the national wealth which the APC could not guarantee.The APC leader unfolded his mind in a lengthy statement he personally signed, entitled “They Go Away Because We Go the Right Way”."

The APC came into being to reverse this unjust equation."
637,officialABAT,2018-06-24 19:50:50+00:00,8. The APC’s formation is the most important political development in our recent history. This is not due to the names of those who founded the party. It is because of the ideals upon which the party was established.
638,officialABAT,2018-06-24 19:50:22+00:00,"7. While they planned a lifetime of greedy enrichment by looting the people’s resources and the public treasury for 60 years, we moved to reform the economy to bring development and aid to the poor."
639,officialABAT,2018-06-24 19:49:53+00:00,"6. With their schemes foiled, those who tried to destroy us must bear witness to the destruction of their edifice of corrupt governance and their dreams of unjust domination of our nation."
640,officialABAT,2018-06-24 19:49:23+00:00,"5. Lacking the courage to face the democratic will of the people, they tried to misuse the courts as a weapon against democracy. We thank the judiciary for following the letter and spirit of the constitution by dismissing this dirty dozen of malicious cases filed against us."
641,officialABAT,2018-06-24 19:49:02+00:00,"4. There were twelve cases brought trying to stop us from merging, from registering the new party, then attempting to bar our candidate from the election."

643,officialABAT,2018-06-24 19:48:08+00:00,"2. Joined in goodwill by common purpose and noble endeavor, we assemble this day.

660,officialABAT,2018-03-30 13:26:44+00:00,13. I will submit a proposal on how we can stimulate the economy. We don’t have to pay for a house of N10 million in one day and with cash; we need mortgage. This would discourage corruption.
661,officialABAT,2018-03-30 13:26:11+00:00,12. We have a nation to rescue; we have a good leader to emulate and we have hope. We have reduced the propensity for corruption. We must strengthen the pension plank to stimulate growth.

(1) We should all know that the APC platform is bigger than us. It will outlive President Buhari. It will also outlive me. Buhari will not be the only president this party will produce. So let all of us work hard to strengthen the party."
676,officialABAT,2018-01-18 18:53:23+00:00,"11. In short, to resolve this lethal problem, government must implement a multi-dimensional policy that encompasses security, agro-economic, educational and emergency relief elements. This is the art and mastery of governance that our nation and its complex problems require."
677,officialABAT,2018-01-18 18:52:59+00:00,"10. Additionally, government should establish a relief and rehabilitation program for those families and communities that have been so grievously harmed."
678,officialABAT,2018-01-18 18:52:25+00:00,"9. Thus, herders have no right to cling to this way of life by killing others. Government must stop their violence but also offer them a viable new way of life by moving them toward more modern, non-nomadic cattle rearing."
679,officialABAT,2018-01-18 18:51:01+00:00,8. The crux of the matter is that the nomadic way of life is fast becoming obsolete. Large scale nomadic practice does not belong in this day and age. This is reality and it is inescapable.
680,officialABAT,2018-01-18 18:50:26+00:00,"7. As we commend these security measures, we must not lose sight of the fact that the problem bears an economic origin. Thus, agro-economic policy initiatives must help shape the lasting solution."
681,officialABAT,2018-01-18 18:50:06+00:00,6. I welcome the deployment of more law enforcement and military into the troubled areas. These security measures will stem the immediate violence and loss of life.
682,officialABAT,2018-01-18 18:49:12+00:00,5. It is incumbent on the federal government to do what past governments neglected to do. We must forget our age-old prejudices in order to resolve herders/farmers' problem. What we need is serious committed action.

We must insist on the principle that elections do not return to being games played by a well-heeled elite while the rest of the nation is left to struggle and starve."
686,officialABAT,2018-01-18 18:45:36+00:00,"2.  Elections are not the climax of an epic book. They are merely the close of the book’s opening chapter.
