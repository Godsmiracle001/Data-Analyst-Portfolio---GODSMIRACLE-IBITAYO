4,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:34:05+00:00,"We implore Prince Dapo Abiodun to roll up his sleeves and begin to work for the people of Ogun State rather than chasing shadows, trying to find fault in every project of the Amosun Administration.  
Architect Segun Abiodun 
Immediate past Hon Commissioner for Housing. Ogun State"
5,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:33:19+00:00,"Thankfully the Amosun led Administration foresaw this and ensured that on-going projects were either fully paid for or advance payments of between 80 - 90% were made. But for this pro- activeness, all the projects would have been truncated."
6,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:32:46+00:00,The comments of Prince Dapo Abiodun so far on projects inherited from the Amosun Administration have indeed confirmed fears that many of them would be denied of funding to frustrate their completion so as to label them as abandoned projects of the Amosun Administration.
7,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:32:23+00:00,"The construction and the furnishing company were carefully and characteristically selected to deliver the high standards for which the Amosun Administration was known,
 ‚ÄùThe Ogun Standard‚Äù."
8,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:31:51+00:00,"For the record, the  architectural design of the judiciary complex was done and supervised by me as the Hon Commisioner for Housing. Incidentally, I designed and supervised the current residence of Prince Dapo Abiodun in Iperu, Ogun State."
9,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:31:22+00:00,"The other contractor Messrs. AFP, (a subsidiary and member of the Julius Berger Group) who handled the panelling and furnishing of the courts, need little or no introduction."
10,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:31:12+00:00,"Its projects also include Nestle Flower Gate Factory, Sagamu, Nestle Distribution Centre, Sagamu and Unilever Distribution Centre, Agbara, all in Ogun State, just to mention a few."
11,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:30:27+00:00,"Among the recent projects executed by the company are the Embassies of the United States of America in Accra, Ghana, Ouagadougou, Burkinna Faso, Monrovia, Liberia and the Dutch Embassy in Lagos, Nigeria."
12,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:30:16+00:00,"The Judiciary complex was constructed by one of the most sought after construction companies in the West African sub-region, De Simone Group(Monterossa)."
13,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:29:46+00:00,The allegation of architectural and structural defects was to create the impression that both the design and construction have been incompetently executed. This is totally baseless and unfounded.
14,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:29:17+00:00,He wondered aloud how the administration was able to fund such a project. The complex has also been widely acknowledged as one of the best judiciary complexes in the country by various stakeholders.
15,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:28:58+00:00,The beauty and utility of the complex was acknowledged by no less a personality than President Muhammadu Buahri who at the commissioning commended the Amosun Administration for conceiving such a laudable project.

1. 13 (Thirteen) court rooms each with a capacity for 200 people and with a complement of judge‚Äôs offices, support staff offices, library and conference facilities."
19,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:26:34+00:00,The Judiciary Complex was conceived to be a world class facility that is compliant with all accessibility and safety standards to provide the State Judiciary with a befitting environment for the dispensation of justice.
20,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:26:20+00:00,"His latest attack was on the Ogun State Judiciary Complex which was commissioned on 25 May, 2019 by President Muhammadu Buhari."
21,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:25:35+00:00,"Prince Dapo Abiodun, rather than embark on programmes and projects that will benefit the good people of Ogun State, has made the demonisation of the programmes and projects of the Amosun administration his cardinal programme."
22,SIAmosun,2019-07-22 17:25:21+00:00,"We are constrained to react to this falsehood because of the emerging pattern of a calculated attempt to rubbish all the good works of Senator Amosun as Governor of Ogun State between 2011 and 2019.

After almost two months in office,"
